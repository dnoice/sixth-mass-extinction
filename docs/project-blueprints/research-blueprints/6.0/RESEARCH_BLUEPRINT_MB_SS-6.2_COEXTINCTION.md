✒ Description:
    This blueprint guides creation of a comprehensive article documenting coextinction
    as the "hidden multiplier" of biodiversity loss. When one species goes extinct,
    dependent species (parasites, mutualists, specialists) follow - amplifying primary
    extinction effects by 184% on average. Coextinction may be the "most insidious
    threat to global biodiversity" - a sixth mass coextinction alongside the sixth
    mass extinction.

✒ Key Features:
    - Coextinction Multiplier: 184% amplification of primary extinction effects
    - Network Fragility: Communities lose up to 50% of ecological interactions
    - Obligate Mutualisms: Fig-wasps, yucca-moths face total coextinction risk
    - Host-Specific Parasites: 66% of primate parasites at coextinction risk
    - Extinction Vortex: Genetic erosion accelerates population collapse
    - Extinction Debt: Species committed to extinction but not yet dead
    - Trophic Complexity Loss: Network connectance and resilience decline

✒ Critical Framing Standards:
    - Coextinction may be "the most common form of biodiversity loss"
    - Every extinction is a NODE in a network, not an isolated event
    - Parasites represent ~50% of all species - their loss is invisible but massive
    - Specialist species at greatest risk - generalists survive, specialists die
    - This is about what we cannot see dying alongside what we can

✒ Usage Instructions:
    This research blueprint provides a 4-week execution framework for creating an
    8,000-10,000 word article documenting coextinction as a biodiversity multiplier.
    Use Week 1 for network theory and modeling, Week 2 for case studies (parasites,
    mutualists), Week 3 for extinction vortex and debt, Week 4 for composition.

✒ Integration Points:
    - Builds on MB_SS-6.1 (Functional Diversity) - functional roles enable cascades
    - Foundation for MB_SS-6.3 (Evolutionary Potential) - cascades erase entire lineages
    - Links to MB_SS-3.1 (Trophic Cascades) - coextinction as cascade mechanism
    - Critical for MB_PS-10.0 (Synthesis) - multiplier effect on biodiversity crisis

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

### Article Focus

This research blueprint guides creation of a comprehensive article examining **coextinction** - the phenomenon where the loss of one species triggers the extinction of dependent species. Primary extinctions are just the visible tip; coextinctions may represent the "most insidious threat to global biodiversity" and the "most common form of biodiversity loss." When modeling includes coextinction, primary extinction effects are amplified by **184%** on average.

### Target Output

- **Stand-alone article:** 8,000-10,000 words
- **Network ecology framing:** Extinction as network fragmentation
- **Coextinction multiplier:** 184% amplification with peer-reviewed sourcing
- **Case studies:** Fig-wasps, yucca-moths, host-specific parasites, Hawaiian honeycreepers
- **Extinction mechanisms:** Vortex, debt, cascade dynamics
- **Hidden biodiversity:** Parasites (~50% of species) as invisible coextinction risk

### Core Thesis

The extinction of a single species is **never an isolated event**. Each species exists within a network of dependencies - parasites, mutualists, pollinators, seed dispersers, and specialists whose survival depends on that species. When one node disappears, dependent nodes follow in cascading coextinction. Models predict coextinctions **amplify primary extinction effects by 184.2%** on average - meaning for every species we count as extinct, nearly two more die unseen. Communities may lose **up to half of all ecological interactions**, reducing network connectance and resilience. Parasites, representing approximately 50% of all species, face massive coextinction risk that goes largely undocumented. The extinction vortex and extinction debt mean populations are "committed to extinction" before they actually die. We are witnessing not just a sixth mass extinction but a **sixth mass coextinction**.

### Critical Framing Note

**Coextinction is the hidden dimension of the biodiversity crisis.** When we count extinctions, we count charismatic megafauna and documented species. We do not count the parasites, the specialist pollinators, the host-specific symbionts that die alongside them. The true scale of loss is systematically underestimated because we cannot see what we never knew existed.

## NOTES FOR FUTURE SELF

### Remember

1. **184.2% is the number.** Coextinctions amplify primary extinctions by nearly double. This is the key statistic.

1. **Parasites are ~50% of species.** And mostly undocumented. The invisible majority is going extinct unseen.

1. **One-to-one mutualisms are doomed.** Fig-wasp: if the fig dies, the wasp dies. No redundancy.

1. **The vortex is self-reinforcing.** Small population → genetic erosion → reduced fitness → smaller population. Spiral to extinction.

1. **Extinction debt is a time bomb.** 80-90% of Amazon extinctions from past deforestation haven't happened yet.

1. **Missing coextinctions are the norm.** We document charismatic megafauna. We don't document their parasites.

1. **Sixth mass coextinction.** Not just extinction - coextinction. The hidden catastrophe.

1. **Networks collapse, not just species.** Up to 50% of ecological interactions lost. Connectance down. Resilience down.

1. **Connect to functional diversity (6.1).** Functions create dependencies. Dependencies create coextinctions.

1. **Connect to evolutionary potential (6.3).** Coextinction cascades erase entire evolutionary lineages.

**"The extinction of a single species is never an isolated event. It is a stone thrown into a pond, and the ripples spread outward until they have touched everything."**

**For every species we count as extinct, nearly two more die unseen. The sixth mass extinction includes a sixth mass coextinction.**
