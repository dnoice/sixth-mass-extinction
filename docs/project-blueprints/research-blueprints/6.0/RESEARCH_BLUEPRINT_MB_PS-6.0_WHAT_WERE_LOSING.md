✒ Description:
    This parent section blueprint provides the overarching integration framework for
    documenting what humanity is actually losing through the sixth mass extinction -
    not just species counts but functional diversity (70% cancer drugs nature-derived),
    coextinction cascades (184% amplification), and evolutionary potential (2.5B+ years
    mammal, 3B+ years bird evolutionary history). The frame is permanent, geological-
    scale impoverishment of Earth's biological heritage.

✒ Key Features:
    - Three Subsection Integration: Functional (6.1) + Coextinction (6.2) + Evolutionary (6.3)
    - Beyond Species Counts: Why taxonomic metrics underestimate loss
    - Hidden Dimensions: Coextinction, extinction debt, functions we don't know exist
    - Geological Permanence: Recovery timescales of millions of years
    - Intrinsic Value: Economic arguments secondary to ethical imperative
    - Irreversibility Frame: What is lost cannot be recovered on human timescales
    - Integration with Synthesis (10.0): Ultimate framing of what we are destroying

✒ Usage Instructions:
    This meta-blueprint guides integration of three sub-sections establishing that
    species extinction counts are the tip of the iceberg - functional diversity loss
    undermines ecosystem services ($125-140T/year), coextinction multiplies primary
    losses by 184%, and evolutionary potential loss is permanent on geological
    timescales. Execute sub-sections (6.1 → 6.2 → 6.3), then synthesize to show
    the full scope of permanent impoverishment.

✒ Integration Points:
    - Builds on MB_PS-3.0 (Ecological Collapse) - ecosystem services quantified
    - Builds on MB_PS-5.0 (Environmental Justice) - who loses what
    - Foundation for MB_PS-7.0 (Tipping Points) - irreversibility established
    - Critical for MB_PS-10.0 (Synthesis) - ultimate framing of loss

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

### Purpose of This Document

This parent section blueprint provides the **comprehensive integration framework** for documenting what humanity is actually losing through the sixth mass extinction - moving beyond species counts to capture the full scope of permanent impoverishment. While Sections 1-5 established WHAT is happening, WHO is responsible, and WHO pays the price, Section 6.0 establishes WHAT IS BEING LOST - the irreplaceable biological heritage being erased.

### The Three Dimensions of Loss

**6.1 FUNCTIONAL DIVERSITY: BEYOND SPECIES COUNTS**

- Medical potential: 70% cancer drugs, 60-80% antibiotics nature-derived
- Ecosystem services: $125-140 trillion annually
- India vulture collapse: $69.4 billion/year damages, 4% mortality increase
- Gastric-brooding frog: Medical potential lost before studied
- Biomimicry: $1.6 trillion potential by 2030
- Technology cannot substitute at ecosystem scale

**6.2 COEXTINCTION: CASCADING LOSSES**

- 184.2% amplification of primary extinction effects
- Communities lose up to 50% of ecological interactions
- ~50% of species are parasites - invisible mass coextinction
- Extinction vortex: Self-reinforcing genetic collapse
- Extinction debt: 80-90% of Amazon extinctions still to come
- Sixth mass coextinction alongside sixth mass extinction

**6.3 EVOLUTIONARY POTENTIAL: MILLIONS OF YEARS LOST**

- 2.5+ billion years mammalian evolutionary history lost
- 3+ billion years avian evolutionary history lost
- 3-5 million years minimum recovery (mammals alone)
- 50 million years for full ecosystem recovery (P-Tr lesson)
- Evolution has "speed limit" - cannot be accelerated
- Permanent on any timescale meaningful to human civilization

### Core Thesis

**Species extinction counts dramatically underestimate the magnitude of loss.** Every extinction removes not just a species but: functional roles in ecosystems ($125-140 trillion in services annually), dependent species that follow (184% amplification via coextinction), and billions of years of accumulated evolutionary innovation that cannot be recovered on human timescales. The gastric-brooding frog went extinct before we could learn how it turned off stomach acid. The India vulture collapse cost $69.4 billion annually and increased human mortality by 4%. The 610 bird species lost since the Pleistocene represent 3 billion years of evolutionary history requiring 3-5 million years to recover - even if extinctions stopped now. This is not a crisis to be managed but a permanent diminishment of Earth's biological heritage. We are destroying the library of life before we have read the books.

## SECTION ARCHITECTURE & INTEGRATION LOGIC

### The Cascading Loss Framework

```
PRIMARY EXTINCTION (visible)
    ↓
Species counts: e.g., 610 birds extinct
    ↓
FUNCTIONAL DIVERSITY LOSS (Section 6.1)
    ↓
Medical potential (70% cancer drugs from nature)
Ecosystem services ($125-140T/year globally)
Technology cannot substitute at scale
    ↓
COEXTINCTION CASCADES (Section 6.2)
    ↓
Primary effects amplified by 184%
Up to 50% interaction loss
Parasites (~50% of species) die unseen
Extinction debt: committed but not yet dead
    ↓
EVOLUTIONARY POTENTIAL LOSS (Section 6.3)
    ↓
Billions of years of evolutionary history
Recovery: 3-50 million years
Speed limit cannot be accelerated
Permanent on human timescales
    ↓
TOTAL LOSS >> Species counts
```

### Cross-Cutting Themes

**SPECIES COUNTS UNDERESTIMATE LOSS**

- Functional diversity loss: 7% of avian functional diversity from 610 species
- Coextinction multiplier: 184% amplification
- Hidden parasites: ~50% of species undocumented
- Pattern: What we count is fraction of what we lose

**IRREVERSIBILITY IS THE KEY**

- Gastric-brooding frog: Gone before studied - forever
- India vultures: Scavenging services irreplaceable
- Evolutionary history: Recovery in millions of years
- Pattern: Lost functions/species cannot return

**TECHNOLOGY CANNOT SUBSTITUTE**

- De-extinction: Makes specimens, not ecosystems
- Colossal's "dire wolf": Modified grey wolf
- Pollination: Cannot be mechanized at scale
- Pattern: Biological complexity irreplaceable

**INTRINSIC VALUE TRANSCENDS UTILITY**

- Economic arguments are persuasive but secondary
- Billions of years of evolution have intrinsic worth
- Ethical obligation to future generations
- Pattern: Beyond anthropocentric valuation

**TEMPORAL INCOMPATIBILITY**

- Human attention: decades
- Species lifespans: millennia
- Ecosystem recovery: millions of years
- Pattern: Crisis timescale exceeds human cognition

**INVISIBLE DIMENSIONS**

- Coextinctions: Not documented, not counted
- Parasites: Half of all species
- Extinction debt: Committed but not realized
- Pattern: True scale systematically unseen

## NOTES FOR FUTURE SELF

### Remember

1. **Species counts are just the tip.** Functional diversity, coextinction, evolutionary potential - each multiplies the true loss.

1. **70% cancer drugs.** This statistic is solid. Use it. Gastric-brooding frog makes it human.

1. **184% amplification.** Coextinction nearly triples the visible loss. For every species we count, 1.84 more die unseen.

1. **5.5+ billion years already lost.** Just mammals and birds. The scale is incomprehensible - make it comprehensible.

1. **50 million years for full recovery.** P-Tr taught us this. 50 million years. Say it again: 50 million years.

1. **Technology cannot substitute.** De-extinction makes specimens, not ecosystems. Colossal's "woolly mammoth" is a modified elephant.

1. **Intrinsic value matters more.** Economic arguments convince policymakers. Ethical arguments are the truth.

1. **Hidden dimensions are huge.** Parasites (50% of species), undescribed species, unknown compounds, futures foreclosed.

1. **This enables Section 10.0.** Without understanding what we're losing, we cannot grasp why transformation is necessary.

1. **Permanent is the word.** On any timescale meaningful to human civilization, this loss is permanent.
