✒ Description:
    This blueprint guides creation of a comprehensive article documenting what the
    sixth mass extinction means for evolutionary potential - the loss of billions of
    years of accumulated evolutionary history and the foreclosure of millions of
    years of future evolutionary possibilities. Recovery from past mass extinctions
    took 5-50 million years; we are erasing the building blocks of future biodiversity.

✒ Key Features:
    - Phylogenetic Diversity Loss: 2.5B years (mammals) + 3B years (birds) already lost
    - Recovery Timescales: 3-5 million years (mammals), 10+ million years ecosystem function
    - "Speed Limit": Evolution cannot be rushed - inherent constraints on speciation
    - Unique Lineages: Entire evolutionary branches going extinct with no close relatives
    - Permian-Triassic Lesson: 50 million years for full ecosystem recovery
    - Human Dominance: Recovery cannot occur while pressures persist
    - Irreversibility Frame: Geological timescales vs. human attention spans

✒ Critical Framing Standards:
    - This is PERMANENT on any timescale meaningful to human civilization
    - Evolution has a "speed limit" - cannot be accelerated by technology
    - We are not just killing species but entire evolutionary lineages
    - Recovery measured in millions of years, human civilization in thousands
    - The magnitude is incomprehensible - make it comprehensible

✒ Usage Instructions:
    This research blueprint provides a 4-week execution framework for creating an
    8,000-10,000 word article documenting evolutionary potential loss. Use Week 1
    for phylogenetic diversity analysis, Week 2 for recovery timescales research,
    Week 3 for unique lineages and future foreclosure, Week 4 for composition.

✒ Integration Points:
    - Builds on MB_SS-6.1 (Functional Diversity) - functions represent evolutionary innovation
    - Builds on MB_SS-6.2 (Coextinction) - cascades erase entire lineages
    - Foundation for MB_SS-7.2 (Irreversible Losses) - geological irreversibility
    - Critical for MB_PS-10.0 (Synthesis) - ultimate framing of loss

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

### Article Focus

This research blueprint guides creation of a comprehensive article examining **evolutionary potential loss** - what the sixth mass extinction means not just for the present but for the geological future. We are erasing billions of years of accumulated evolutionary history and foreclosing millions of years of future evolutionary possibility. Past mass extinctions took 5-50 million years to recover; evolution has a "speed limit" that cannot be accelerated.

### Target Output

- **Stand-alone article:** 8,000-10,000 words
- **Geological timescale framing:** Recovery measured in millions of years
- **Phylogenetic diversity quantified:** 2.5B+ years mammals, 3B+ years birds lost
- **Recovery evidence:** Permian-Triassic, K-Pg lessons for current crisis
- **Unique lineages documentation:** Evolutionary branches with no close relatives
- **Human dominance reality:** Recovery impossible while pressures persist
- **Irreversibility made tangible:** Geological time vs. human comprehension

### Core Thesis

The sixth mass extinction is erasing not just species but **entire branches of the evolutionary tree** - billions of years of accumulated evolutionary history representing unique solutions to life's challenges. The incipient extinction has already erased **2.5+ billion years** of mammalian evolutionary history and **3+ billion years** of avian evolutionary history. Past mass extinctions required **3-5 million years** for mammalian diversity recovery and **10-50 million years** for full ecosystem functional recovery. Evolution has an inherent "speed limit" - the time required to generate new traits, fill vacant niches, and rebuild ecosystem complexity. This cannot be accelerated by technology. We are foreclosing evolutionary possibilities that would otherwise have unfolded over the next millions of years. On any timescale meaningful to human civilization, these losses are **absolutely permanent**.

### Critical Framing Note

**This section confronts the temporal incomprehensibility of the crisis.** Humans think in decades; evolution operates in millions of years. We must make geological timescales emotionally comprehensible while maintaining scientific accuracy. The key insight: modern humans have existed for ~300,000 years. Recovery from what we are causing will take 10-30 times longer than our entire existence as a species. This is not a problem to be solved; it is a permanent diminishment of Earth's biological heritage.

   **Source:** World Economic Forum (October 2018)

   **Key Finding:**
   Accessible synthesis of Davis et al. research - even with immediate halt to extinctions, mammals would need 3-5 million years to naturally recover lost phylogenetic diversity. If extinctions continue for 50 years, recovery extends accordingly.

   **Research Tasks:**

1. **Billions of years is tangible:** Reader grasps scale of 2.5B mammals + 3B birds

1. **Speed limit is understood:** Cannot accelerate evolution regardless of technology

1. **P-Tr lesson is clear:** 50 million years for full ecosystem recovery

1. **K-Pg permanence documented:** Non-avian dinosaurs never replaced

1. **Unique lineages are vivid:** EDGE species as irreplaceable evolutionary branches

1. **Human timescale contrast works:** 300,000 years vs. 5-50 million years felt

1. **Human dominance prevents recovery:** Recovery cannot begin under current pressures

1. **Temporal vertigo achieved:** Reader experiences incomprehensibility of timescales

1. **Tree of life pruning is visual:** Entire branches removed, not just leaves

1. **Integration is seamless:** Links to 6.1 (Functional), 6.2 (Coextinction), 10.0 (Synthesis)

---

## NOTES FOR FUTURE SELF

### Remember

1. **2.5 billion + 3 billion = 5.5 billion years.** Just mammals and birds. Underestimate of total.

1. **3-5 million years minimum.** For mammals alone. If extinctions stopped NOW.

1. **50 million years for full ecosystem.** P-Tr taught us this. 50 million years.

1. **Non-avian dinosaurs never came back.** Some losses are genuinely permanent.

1. **Speed limit is real.** Evolution cannot be accelerated. This is not a technology problem.

1. **300,000 years human existence.** Recovery takes 10-30x longer than we have existed.

1. **Recovery requires low pressure.** Human dominance prevents recovery from even beginning.

1. **Tree of life visualization.** Not just species dots but entire BRANCHES being removed.

1. **Connect to functional diversity (6.1).** Functions represent millions of years of evolutionary innovation.

1. **Connect to coextinction (6.2).** Cascades erase entire lineages at once.

| Event | Taxonomic Recovery | Ecosystem Recovery | Source |
|-------|-------------------|-------------------|--------|
| Permian-Triassic | 5M years (predators) | 50M years | Multiple |
| K-Pg | Variable | Ongoing | Multiple |
| Current (projected) | 3-5M years minimum | Unknown | Davis et al. |

### Human vs. Geological Time

| Scale | Duration | Comparison |
|-------|----------|------------|
| Modern humans | 300,000 years | 1x |
| Minimum mammal recovery | 3-5M years | 10-17x |
| Full ecosystem recovery | 50M years | 167x |
| Age of dinosaurs | 165M years | 550x |

### Mass Extinction Comparison

| Event | Species Loss | Recovery Time | Driver |
|-------|--------------|---------------|--------|
| Permian-Triassic | 90% marine | 50M years | Siberian Traps |
| K-Pg | 75% species | Variable | Asteroid |
| Current | Ongoing | Unknown | Anthropogenic |
