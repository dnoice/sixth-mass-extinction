✒ Description:
    This blueprint guides creation of a comprehensive article documenting consumption
    inequality as extinction driver, from richest 1% = 16% of emissions to working-class
    Americans trapped in car-dependent systems to Bangladesh bearing catastrophic costs
    for crisis it didn't create, establishing class war not "Americans vs Bangladeshis."

✒ Key Features:
    - Elite Emissions Concentration: Richest 10% = 50%, 1% = 16%, 0.1% = 6%
    - Luxury vs Systemic Distinction: Private jets (choice) vs car-dependent suburbs (trapped)
    - Working-Class Solidarity Framing: American AND Bangladeshi workers both victims
    - Country Emissions Corrected: US 14.4 tonnes (NOT 16), Bangladesh 0.7 (NOT 0.5)
    - Private Jets Clarified: 5-14x commercial aviation (NOT 50x), 50x vs trains
    - Environmental Justice: Cancer Alley 700x, PFAS 45%, Flint, Navajo 23x uranium
    - Climate Refugees: 216M by 2050 (World Bank), 21.9M annually displaced (IDMC)
    - Class Hierarchy: Elite (architects) → Comfortable middle class (complicit) → Working class (trapped) → Global South (victims)
    - NOT "Average Americans": Distinguishes working class (no alternatives) from comfortable (has choices)
    - Post-Growth Alternatives: Consumption reduction pathways within planetary boundaries

✒ Usage Instructions:
    This research blueprint provides a 4-week execution framework for creating a
    7,000-9,000 word article establishing consumption inequality through class lens,
    NOT geography. Use Week 1 for elite emissions (richest 1%/10%), Week 2 for
    luxury vs systemic distinction, Week 3 for environmental justice, Week 4 for
    working-class solidarity synthesis and composition.

✒ Integration Points:
    - Built on MB_SS-4.1 (Capitalism) - growth requires consumption expansion
    - Follows MB_SS-4.2 (Corporate Power) - corporations market overconsumption
    - Enabled by MB_SS-4.3 (Government Failure) - subsidies enable elite emissions
    - Links MB_PS-5.0 (Environmental Justice) - inequality is environmental racism
    - Critical for MB_PS-10.0 (Synthesis) - class solidarity vs elite, not nation vs nation

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

### Document Purpose

This blueprint provides a comprehensive research framework for analyzing how **unequal consumption patterns drive extinction**, examining the systemic structures that concentrate ecological impact among the richest populations while trapping working-class populations in consumption patterns they did not design or choose.

**Core Thesis:** Global consumption inequality is not a result of individual choice or "lifestyle differences," but rather emerges from deliberate economic systems that concentrate purchasing power, control over production, supply chain architecture, and marketing influence in the hands of a global elite. Working-class populations—both in wealthy nations and the Global South—are systematically trapped in systems designed to maximize consumption and environmental impact.

### Key Research Questions

1. **What are the actual distribution patterns of consumption and carbon footprints globally?**
   - How much of global consumption comes from richest versus poorest populations?
   - What is the relationship between consumption inequality and extinction drivers?
   - How has consumption inequality changed over the past 30 years?

1. **What systemic mechanisms perpetuate consumption inequality?**
   - How do economic structures concentrate consumption opportunities among elites?
   - What roles do corporations, advertising, supply chains, and policy play?
   - How are working-class populations trapped in unsustainable consumption patterns?

1. **What is the ecological impact of elite consumption specifically?**
   - What are the carbon footprints and resource requirements of high-end consumption?
   - How do private jets, yachts, luxury goods, and single-use culture concentrate impact?
   - What would global carbon/resource targets require in terms of consumption redistribution?

1. **How does consumption inequality intersect with environmental justice?**
   - Who bears the costs of consumption produced by elites (pollution, displacement, health)?
   - What are the specific cases of environmental racism linked to elite consumption?
   - How do climate migrants and pollution frontline communities experience elite consumption?

1. **What alternatives exist to consumption-based economic systems?**
   - What is economically viable without growth-based capitalism?
   - How have other systems managed resources more equitably?
   - What would a post-consumption economy require?

### Foundational Findings (Preliminary)

**Consumption Distribution:**

- Richest 10% of global population: approximately 50% of global emissions [S36]
- Richest 1% of global population: approximately 16% of global emissions [S37]
- Richest 0.1% of global population: approximately 6% of global emissions [S37]
- Average person in US: 14.4 tonnes CO2e per year [S38]
- Average person in Bangladesh: 0.7 tonnes CO2e per year [S36]
- Single high-wealth individual: 50-100+ tonnes CO2e per year (private jets, yachts, estates)

**Elite Consumption Impact:**

- Private aviation: 5-14x higher emissions per passenger-kilometer than commercial [S39]
- 0.04% of global population takes 50% of ultra-long private flights [S39]
- Luxury yacht emissions: 200+ tonnes per night operation [S39]
- Elite consumption growth: +60% from 1990-2015 despite climate awareness [S36]

**Systemic Drivers:**

- Supply chain globalization concentrates profit capture while externalizing environmental costs
- Marketing and consumer culture deliberately engineered to drive consumption among working-class
- Planned obsolescence ensures continuous replacement cycles
- Access to credit systematizes working-class debt-driven consumption
- Carbon pricing mechanisms preserve elite privilege while raising working-class costs

**Environmental Justice Intersection:**

- Cancer Alley residents exposed to 700x national average of toxic chemicals [Johns Hopkins Cancer Alley Study]
- PFAS contamination in drinking water: 45% of US population affected [S40]
- Climate migration: 216 million climate refugees projected by 2050 without mitigation [World Bank Groundswell]
- Manufacturing pollution concentrated in low-income communities, Global South factories

### Scope & Limitations

**What This Blueprint Covers:**

- Global consumption distribution patterns and trends
- Systemic mechanisms perpetuating consumption inequality
- Ecological footprints of high-consumption groups (especially ultra-wealthy)
- Environmental justice intersections (pollution exposure, displacement, climate migration)
- Supply chain externalities and working-class entrapment
- Systemic alternatives and post-growth frameworks

**What This Blueprint Does NOT Cover:**

- Individual moral judgment (focus is systemic, not personal blame)
- Individual lifestyle prescriptions ("eat less meat," etc.)
- Technological fixes without systemic change
- Detailed policy proposals (that is Section 5.0)

**Intentional Framing:**
This blueprint explicitly rejects the framing of "average Americans are the problem." Instead, it uses working-class solidarity framing: **American working-class populations are trapped in systems designed by elites, just as Bangladeshi workers are trapped in supply chains designed to concentrate profit and externalize costs.** The problem is not consumption per se, but the systems that concentrate consumption opportunities, hide true costs, and trap people in unsustainable patterns.

**Geographic Focus:**

- Primary: Global North (US, EU, Australia, Canada, Japan)
- Secondary: Global South manufacturing hubs (Bangladesh, Vietnam, India, Indonesia)
- Tertiary: Climate-vulnerable nations (Small Island States, Sahel, Sub-Saharan Africa)

**Temporal Frame:**

- Baseline: 1990 (start of modern globalization)
- Focus period: 2000-2025
- Forward projection: 2025-2050

## QUALITY CONTROL FRAMEWORK

### Citation Verification Protocol

Every citation must be cross-referenced against source documents. All major claims require minimum two independent sources. Consumption distribution figures verified against Oxfam, Global Carbon Project, World Bank, and alternative sources. All percentages, carbon figures, and statistical claims cross-checked for accuracy. Methodological differences between sources acknowledged and confidence ranges explicitly documented.

### Framing Consistency Review

Language must blame systems, not individuals. American working-class understood as trapped by marketing, debt, and wage stagnation—not as villains. Bangladeshi workers understood as trapped by extreme poverty and manufacturing job dependence—not as responsible for consumption. Global South populations presented as victims of high-consumption country systems, not as "developing" and needing to "catch up." Responsibility properly attributed to systems, policies, and corporate structures—not to people without power.

### Data Accuracy Verification

Minimum 30 spot-checks of key claims verifying against source documents. Billionaire emissions (1,000+ tonnes annually) verified against Nature Energy study. Supply chain profit distribution (70-80% wealthy countries, 5-15% producing countries) verified against multiple sources. Worker wages ($2-4/day) cross-referenced with ILO data and supply chain studies. Environmental justice impacts (Cancer Alley 700x, PFAS 45%, lead disparities) verified against academic studies.

### Cross-Reference Completeness Check

Section 4.4 properly linked to Section 4.1 (capitalism's growth imperative driving consumption), Section 4.2 (corporate mechanisms—marketing, planned obsolescence, greenwashing), Section 4.3 (supply chain inequality perpetuating consumption inequality), Section 2.0 (consumption inequality driving extinction mechanisms). All cross-references have specific citations and are bidirectional.

## CRITICAL INSIGHTS FOR RESEARCH EXECUTION

**Data Availability:** Global Carbon Project and Oxfam reports most reliable consumption inequality sources. Supply chain data fragmented; requires synthesis. Elite consumption data limited; Nature private aviation study is best available. Environmental justice data strong from EPA/CDC/Johns Hopkins.

**Source Quality:** Tier 1 sources (IPBES, IPCC, FAO, World Bank) most reliable for baseline statistics. Nature/Science peer-reviewed articles highly reliable. Government data (EPA, CDC) excellent for US pollution; developing country data variable. Oxfam and WRI reliable NGO sources; cross-verify advocacy-heavy reports.

**Framing Development:** Working-class solidarity framing powerful but complex. Key insight: American working-class AND Bangladeshi workers share enemy (elite consumption + corporate systems). Avoid guilt/blame frameworks. Emphasize systemic entrapment differentially (wage stagnation/marketing in wealthy countries; extreme poverty in Global South), not competition.

**Systemic Mechanisms:** Marketing intentional (documented corporate strategy). Debt systemic (not individual failure). Planned obsolescence business strategy. Regulatory capture deliberate (corporate lobbying documented). Policy mechanisms (subsidies, trade agreements) designed to enable over-consumption.

**Supply Chain Insights:** Profit distribution (70-80% wealthy countries, 5-15% producing) direct outcome of system design. Worker wages stagnant despite productivity/price increases. Environmental costs massive, systematically hidden from consumers.

**Common Pitfalls:** Don't oversimplify consumption as individual choice. Don't blame working-class. Don't use orientalist language. Don't ignore within-country inequality. Don't treat alternatives as fantasy. Don't separate consumption inequality from environmental justice.

---

## CONCLUSION & RESEARCH READINESS

This blueprint comprehensively addresses how global consumption inequality drives extinction through systemic mechanisms concentrating ecological impact among the richest populations while trapping working-class populations—both in wealthy nations and Global South—in unsustainable consumption patterns. The framework emphasizes working-class solidarity, environmental justice, and evidence-based systemic alternatives.

Research is ready for Week 1 initiation of data acquisition phase.
