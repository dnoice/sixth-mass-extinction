✒ Description:
    This blueprint guides creation of a comprehensive article documenting corporate power
    concentration as extinction driver, from Carbon Majors (57 entities = 80% post-Paris
    fossil CO₂) to agricultural giants (JBS, Cargill, Wilmar) to lobbying expenditures
    ($72M in 6 months) creating "too big to regulate" entities blocking transformation.

✒ Key Features:
    - Carbon Majors Database Analysis: 57 entities = 80% fossil CO₂ (2016-2022 post-Paris)
    - Top 5 Attribution: ExxonMobil, Chevron, BP, Shell, ConocoPhillips = 11.1% historical
    - Just 36 Companies: 50% of 2023 global fossil CO₂ emissions
    - Agricultural Supply Chains: JBS (cattle), Cargill (soy), Wilmar (palm oil) traced to deforestation
    - Lobbying Expenditures: $72M oil industry (6 months 2024 US), blocking climate policy
    - Revolving Door Documentation: Industry ↔ government personnel tracking
    - Disinformation Campaigns: Fossil fuel denial funding since 1970s
    - "Too Big to Regulate": Corporate power exceeding state capacity
    - Legal Accountability: Climate Superfund laws (Vermont, New York) using Carbon Majors data
    - Corporate Consolidation Timeline: Mergers creating unregulatable monopolies

✒ Usage Instructions:
    This research blueprint provides a 4-week execution framework for creating an
    8,000-10,000 word article naming specific corporations responsible for disproportionate
    destruction. Use Week 1 for Carbon Majors analysis, Week 2 for agricultural supply
    chains, Week 3 for lobbying/revolving door, Week 4 for composition.

✒ Integration Points:
    - Built on MB_SS-4.1 (Capitalism) - growth imperative creates corporate concentration
    - Foundation for MB_SS-4.3 (Government Failure) - corporate power captures government
    - Connects MB_SS-4.4 (Consumption Inequality) - corporate consolidation concentrates wealth
    - Links MB_PS-2.0 (Primary Drivers) - corporations execute the destruction
    - Critical for MB_PS-10.0 (Synthesis) - named entities blocking transformation

## CORPORATE POWER & RESPONSIBILITY

---

## Document Control

**Blueprint ID:** MB_SS-4.2
**Parent Section:** MB_PS-4.0 (Economic Systems Driving Extinction)
**Section Coverage:** 4.2 Corporate Power & Responsibility
**Research Depth:** Deep Dive - Stand-Alone Article
**Integration:** Component of Master Stack
**Version:** 1.0.0
**Date:** 2025-01-20
**Status:** Research Framework - Ready for Execution

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

### Article Focus

This research blueprint guides creation of a comprehensive article examining **"Which specific corporations are responsible for mass extinction and how their concentrated power blocks transformation"** by documenting Carbon Majors emissions attribution, agricultural supply chains, lobbying expenditures, and the "too big to regulate" phenomenon.

### Target Output

- **Stand-alone article:** 8,000-10,000 words
- **Corporate attribution:** Name ExxonMobil, Chevron, BP, Shell, JBS, Cargill, Wilmar with quantified impacts
- **Supply chain tracing:** Forest to consumer product pathways
- **Lobbying documentation:** $72M+ expenditures blocking climate policy

### Core Thesis

Corporate concentration has created entities "too big to regulate"—57 fossil fuel/cement producers responsible for 80% of post-Paris CO₂ emissions, agricultural giants (JBS, Cargill, Wilmar) driving deforestation through traceable supply chains, and lobbying expenditures ($72M in 6 months, oil industry alone) that dwarf regulatory budgets and block transformation. These are not "bad apples" but structural features: growth imperative creates concentration, concentration creates political power, political power blocks regulation.

---

## RESEARCH OBJECTIVES

### Primary Questions to Answer

1. **Which corporations are responsible for what share of emissions/destruction?**
1. **How do corporate lobbying expenditures block climate/environmental policy?**
1. **What is the "revolving door" between industry and government?**
1. **How are agricultural supply chains traced from forest to consumer?**
1. **Why are corporations "too big to regulate"?**

### Secondary Questions

1. When did fossil fuel companies learn about climate change?
1. How much have they spent on disinformation campaigns?
1. What legal accountability mechanisms exist (Climate Superfund laws)?
1. How has corporate consolidation accelerated (mergers/acquisitions)?
1. What would breaking corporate power require?
