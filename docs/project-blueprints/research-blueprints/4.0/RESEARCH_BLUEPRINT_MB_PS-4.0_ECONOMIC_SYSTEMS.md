✒ Description:
    This parent section blueprint provides the overarching integration framework for
    documenting how economic systems—capitalism's infinite growth imperative, corporate
    power concentration, governmental failure, and consumption inequality—drive the sixth
    mass extinction as structural necessities rather than policy failures.

✒ Key Features:
    - Four Subsection Integration: Capitalism (4.1), Corporate Power (4.2), Government Failure (4.3), Consumption Inequality (4.4)
    - Systemic Analysis Framework: Not individual bad actors but system design driving destruction
    - Economic Contradiction Documentation: Infinite growth on finite planet = impossible
    - Corporate Attribution Database: Carbon Majors (57 entities = 80% post-Paris emissions)
    - Subsidy Quantification: $7 trillion fossil fuels, $540B agriculture, $35B fishing
    - Regulatory Capture Analysis: Revolving door, lobbying expenditures, policy capture
    - Natural Capital Accounting: $125-140 trillion ecosystem services ignored in GDP
    - Inequality Documentation: Richest 10% = 50% emissions, poorest bear costs
    - Alternative Economics: Degrowth, steady-state, doughnut economics, post-growth
    - Integrated Synthesis Article: 12,000-15,000 word unified critique of growth-based economics

✒ Usage Instructions:
    This meta-blueprint guides integration of four sub-sections establishing that extinction
    is not accidental but structurally embedded in current economic systems. Execute
    sub-sections first (4.1 → 4.2 → 4.3 → 4.4), then use this framework for synthesis
    demonstrating systemic causation requiring systemic solutions.

✒ Integration Points:
    - Builds on MB_PS-2.0 (Primary Drivers) - drivers embedded in economic system design
    - Foundation for MB_PS-5.0 (Environmental Justice) - inequality is structural
    - Connects MB_PS-7.0 (Tipping Points) - growth imperative accelerates toward boundaries
    - Enables MB_PS-8.0 (Failed Solutions) - why techno-fixes can't overcome systemic drivers
    - Critical for MB_PS-10.0 (Synthesis) - systemic causation requires systemic transformation

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

### Purpose of This Document

This parent section blueprint provides the **comprehensive integration framework** for documenting how economic systems—not individual failures but structural design—drive the Sixth Mass Extinction. While MB_PS-2.0 documented WHAT destroys ecosystems (drivers), MB_PS-4.0 establishes WHY those drivers are systemic necessities of capitalism's infinite growth imperative rather than correctable policy errors.

### The Four Economic Mechanisms

**4.1 CAPITALISM & INFINITE GROWTH PARADIGM**

- Core contradiction: Infinite growth on finite planet
- Planetary boundaries: 6 of 9 already transgressed
- GDP fetishism: Growth prioritized over all else
- Externalized costs: Pollution/destruction not priced

**4.2 CORPORATE POWER & CONCENTRATION**

- Carbon Majors: 57 entities = 80% post-Paris emissions (2016-2022)
- Agricultural giants: JBS, Cargill, Wilmar driving deforestation
- Lobbying expenditures: $72M (6 months, oil industry alone)
- Revolving door: Industry insiders writing regulations

**4.3 GOVERNMENTAL FAILURE & CAPTURE**

- Fossil fuel subsidies: $7 trillion globally (2022)
- Agricultural subsidies: $540 billion annually
- Fishing subsidies: $35 billion annually
- "Paper parks": Protection without enforcement
- Regulatory capture: Industry controls regulators

**4.4 CONSUMPTION INEQUALITY**

- Richest 10%: ~50% of consumption emissions
- Richest 1%: ~15% of emissions
- Environmental racism: Poor suffer, wealthy cause
- Luxury emissions: Private jets, superyachts, space tourism

### Core Thesis

**The Sixth Mass Extinction is not an accidental externality of economic activity but a structural requirement of capitalism's infinite growth imperative operating on a finite planet.** Corporate concentration creates entities too powerful to regulate, governments are captured by the industries they should control, and consumption inequality ensures those causing destruction don't bear its costs. This is not fixable through policy tweaks—it requires systemic economic transformation to degrowth, steady-state, or post-growth models that operate within planetary boundaries.

## SECTION ARCHITECTURE & INTEGRATION LOGIC

### The Systemic Causation Framework

```
CAPITALISM (infinite growth imperative)
    ↓
Requires endless expansion
    ↓
Creates CORPORATE CONCENTRATION (economies of scale)
    ↓
Corporations gain political power
    ↓
Leads to GOVERNMENT CAPTURE (lobbying, revolving door)
    ↓
Regulations weakened, subsidies flow
    ↓
Enables CONSUMPTION INEQUALITY (wealth concentration)
    ↓
Rich externalize costs onto poor
    ↓
PLANETARY BOUNDARIES TRANSGRESSED
    ↓
MASS EXTINCTION
```

### Cross-Cutting Themes

**EXTERNALIZATION AS CORE FEATURE**

- Pollution costs not borne by producers/consumers
- Future generations pay for current consumption
- Pattern: Privatized profits, socialized costs

**SHORT-TERMISM STRUCTURALLY REQUIRED**

- Quarterly earnings drive corporate decisions
- Electoral cycles (2-6 years) vs. ecological timescales (decades-centuries)
- Pattern: Immediate gain prioritized over long-term sustainability

**REGULATORY CAPTURE AS INEVITABLE**

- Industries fund political campaigns
- Revolving door between industry and regulation
- Pattern: Foxes guarding henhouse

**GROWTH IMPERATIVE AS NON-NEGOTIABLE**

- Capitalism requires 2-3% annual GDP growth to avoid crisis
- No growth = recession, unemployment, instability
- Pattern: Treadmill acceleration

**INEQUALITY ENABLES EXTERNALIZATION**

- Wealthy cause disproportionate damage
- Poor lack political power to resist
- Pattern: Unequal exchange

**PLANETARY BOUNDARIES AS HARD LIMITS**

- Economics assumes infinite substitutability
- Ecology reveals absolute constraints
- Pattern: Collision course

**Key Focus:** Why infinite growth on finite planet is impossible
**Critical Thinkers:** Herman Daly, Jason Hickel, Kate Raworth, Tim Jackson, Vaclav Smil

**Core Arguments:**

- Capitalism structurally requires 2-3% annual GDP growth to avoid crisis

**Quantitative Anchors:**

- 6 of 9 planetary boundaries transgressed (Richardson et al. 2023)
- Natural capital per person: -40% (1992-2014) while produced capital doubled
- GDP growth requirement: ~2-3% annually to avoid recession

## NOTES FOR FUTURE SELF

### Remember

1. **This is THE political economy section.** Section 2.0 showed WHAT destroys ecosystems. Section 4.0 shows WHY those drivers persist: systemic economic design, not policy failure.

1. **Attribution is everything.** Don't say "capitalism causes extinction." Say "Capitalism requires 2-3% annual GDP growth to avoid recession; this growth imperative collides with 6 of 9 transgressed planetary boundaries."

1. **Systems, not individuals.** Not "greedy CEOs" but "corporations structured to maximize shareholder returns in quarterly timeframes."

1. **Alternatives are not utopian.** Degrowth, steady-state, doughnut economics are rigorously theorized frameworks with empirical grounding.

1. **Power is structural.** Regulatory capture is not corruption but system functioning as designed.

1. **Integration is synthesis.** The synthesis chapter is not summary but analysis of HOW mechanisms interlock.
