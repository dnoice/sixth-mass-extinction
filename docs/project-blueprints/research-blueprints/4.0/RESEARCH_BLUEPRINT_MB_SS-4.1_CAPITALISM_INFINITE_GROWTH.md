✒ Description:
    This blueprint guides creation of a comprehensive article documenting the fundamental
    contradiction of capitalism—infinite growth imperative colliding with finite planetary
    boundaries—as the systemic driver of mass extinction, from GDP fetishism to natural
    capital depletion (-40% per person 1992-2014) to the impossibility of green growth.

✒ Key Features:
    - Growth Imperative Analysis: Why capitalism requires 2-3% annual GDP growth
    - Planetary Boundaries Collision: 6 of 9 boundaries already transgressed
    - Decoupling Myth Exposure: Absolute decoupling not observed at global scale
    - Jevons Paradox Documentation: Efficiency gains increase consumption
    - Natural Capital Depletion: -40% per capita while produced capital doubled
    - Dasgupta Review Integration: Natural capital vs. GDP contradiction
    - Alternative Economics Framework: Degrowth, steady-state, doughnut, post-growth
    - Eco logical Footprint Analysis: 1.6 Earths needed for current consumption
    - Material Flow Accounting: Vaclav Smil's constraints analysis
    - Doughnut Economics Assessment: No nation living within safe/just space

✒ Usage Instructions:
    This research blueprint provides a 4-week execution framework for creating an
    8,000-10,000 word article establishing capitalism's growth imperative as structurally
    incompatible with planetary boundaries. Use Week 1 for growth imperative analysis,
    Week 2 for planetary boundaries collision, Week 3 for alternative economics, Week 4
    for composition and integration.

✒ Integration Points:
    - Foundation for MB_SS-4.2 (Corporate Power) - growth creates concentration
    - Enables MB_SS-4.3 (Government Failure) - growth imperative blocks reform
    - Supports MB_SS-4.4 (Consumption Inequality) - growth requires consumption expansion
    - Connects MB_PS-7.0 (Tipping Points) - growth accelerates boundary transgression
    - Critical for MB_PS-10.0 (Synthesis) - systemic transformation required

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

### Article Focus

This research blueprint guides creation of a comprehensive article examining **"Why capitalism's infinite growth imperative makes mass extinction structurally inevitable"** by documenting the collision between GDP growth requirements and planetary boundaries, exposing decoupling myths, and presenting alternative economic models.

### Target Output

- **Stand-alone article:** 8,000-10,000 words
- **Quantitative emphasis:** 6/9 boundaries transgressed, -40% natural capital, 1.6 Earths needed
- **Alternative frameworks:** Degrowth, steady-state, doughnut, post-growth economics
- **Theoretical depth:** Growth imperative, Jevons paradox, externalization, discounting

### Core Thesis

Capitalism structurally requires 2-3% annual GDP growth to avoid recession, unemployment, and financial crisis—a growth imperative fundamentally incompatible with operating within planetary boundaries. With 6 of 9 boundaries already transgressed and natural capital declining 40% per person (1992-2014), the collision between infinite growth and finite planet drives mass extinction not as policy failure but as system functioning normally. Green growth cannot resolve this contradiction—systemic transformation to degrowth, steady-state, or post-growth economics is required.

---

## RESEARCH OBJECTIVES

### Primary Questions to Answer

1. **Why does capitalism structurally require continuous GDP growth?**
1. **What are planetary boundaries and how many are already transgressed?**
1. **Has "green growth" (decoupling growth from environmental impact) occurred at scale?**
1. **What is the Jevons paradox and how does it undermine efficiency gains?**
1. **What alternative economic models operate within planetary boundaries?**

### Secondary Questions

1. How has natural capital changed relative to produced capital (1992-2014)?
1. What is the ecological footprint of current consumption patterns?
1. How do discounting and short-termism bias against sustainability?
1. Why does GDP ignore ecosystem services and natural capital depletion?
1. What would be required to transition to post-growth economics?

## CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS

This Article Succeeds If:

1. **Growth imperative is crystal clear:** Non-economists understand why capitalism requires continuous growth

1. **Planetary boundaries collision is undeniable:** 6 of 9 transgressed, documented with authoritative sources

1. **Decoupling myth is thoroughly exposed:** Absolute decoupling not observed; Jevons paradox explained

1. **Natural capital depletion is quantified:** -40% per capita while produced capital doubled

1. **Alternative economics are fairly presented:** Degrowth, steady-state, doughnut not dismissed as utopian

1. **Integration with Section 4.0 is seamless:** Growth creates concentration (4.2), blocks reform (4.3), requires consumption expansion (4.4)

1. **Economic theory is accessible:** Clear explanations without jargon

1. **Data is bulletproof:** Every number sourced, uncertainty acknowledged

1. **Visualizations are compelling:** Complex concepts made clear through graphics

1. **Political economy is honest:** Why transformation blocked, not just what would work

## NOTES FOR FUTURE SELF

### Remember

1. **Growth imperative is not greed:** It's structural feature of capitalism. Don't moralize—analyze.

1. **Planetary boundaries are hard limits:** Not "goals" or "targets" but physical thresholds with consequences.

1. **Green growth is oxymoron:** Efficiency gains increase consumption (Jevons paradox). Decoupling not observed at scale.

1. **Alternative economics are rigorous:** Not utopian fantasies but theoretically grounded, empirically informed frameworks.

1. **Natural capital matters:** -40% per capita is catastrophic. GDP ignores this entirely.

1. **No false hope:** Degrowth/steady-state/post-growth are necessary but politically blocked. Be honest.

1. **Integration is key:** This article enables 4.2 (corporate power), 4.3 (government failure), 4.4 (inequality).

1. **Accessibility matters:** Non-economists must understand growth imperative. Clear language, good visualizations.

1. **Quantification is critical:** "Infinite growth on finite planet" is slogan. 6/9 boundaries, -40% natural capital is evidence.

1. **Political economy is essential:** WHY hasn't transformation occurred? Vested interests, ideological hegemony, recession fear.
