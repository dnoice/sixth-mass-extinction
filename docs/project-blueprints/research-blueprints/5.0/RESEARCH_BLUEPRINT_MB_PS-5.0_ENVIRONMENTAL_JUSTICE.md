✒ Description:
    This parent section blueprint provides the overarching integration framework for
    documenting environmental justice as a lens for understanding who bears the costs
    of ecological collapse - Indigenous peoples as superior stewards facing systematic
    violence (2,253 killed 2012-2024), frontline communities bearing toxic burden
    (Cancer Alley 700x cancer risk), and climate displacement as mass crisis (45.8M
    in 2024). The frame is working-class solidarity against extractive capitalism.

✒ Key Features:
    - Two Subsection Integration: Indigenous Peoples (5.1) + Frontline Communities (5.2)
    - Working-Class Solidarity Frame: Global elite vs. working people everywhere
    - Shared Struggle Analysis: Same enemies, different manifestations
    - Justice Framing: Reparations, land back, systemic transformation - NOT charity
    - State & Corporate Complicity: Named perpetrators, documented impunity
    - Resistance Documentation: Active resistors, not passive victims
    - Integration with Economic Systems (4.0): Sacrifice zones enable capital accumulation
    - Foundation for Synthesis (10.0): Environmental justice as precondition for transformation

✒ Usage Instructions:
    This meta-blueprint guides integration of two sub-sections establishing that
    environmental collapse has human faces - Indigenous defenders killed fighting,
    frontline communities bearing toxic burden, climate refugees displaced. Execute
    sub-sections first (5.1 → 5.2), then use this framework for synthesis demonstrating
    shared struggle against common enemies requiring justice-centered solutions.

✒ Integration Points:
    - Builds on MB_PS-4.0 (Economic Systems) - externalized costs racialized/colonized
    - Foundation for MB_PS-8.0 (Failed Solutions) - techno-fixes ignore justice
    - Critical for MB_PS-10.0 (Synthesis) - justice is precondition for transformation
    - Links MB_SS-4.2 (Corporate Power) + MB_SS-4.3 (Government Failure) to human impacts

## ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE - PARENT SECTION

---

## Document Control

**Blueprint ID:** MB_PS-5.0
**Document Type:** Parent Section Overview
**Sub-Sections:** MB_SS-5.1, MB_SS-5.2
**Research Depth:** Meta-Framework & Integration Guide
**Version:** 1.0.0
**Date:** 2025-11-26
**Status:** Overview Framework - Ready for Integration

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

### Purpose of This Document

This parent section blueprint provides the **comprehensive integration framework** for documenting environmental justice - understanding who bears the costs of ecological collapse. While MB_PS-4.0 established WHY destruction persists (economic systems), MB_PS-5.0 establishes WHO pays the price: Indigenous peoples defending territories at the cost of their lives, frontline communities bearing toxic burden in sacrifice zones, and climate refugees displaced by disasters their emissions did not cause.

### The Two Environmental Justice Mechanisms

**5.1 INDIGENOUS PEOPLES & TRADITIONAL ECOLOGICAL KNOWLEDGE**

- Superior stewardship: 66-83% lower deforestation on Indigenous lands
- Systematic violence: 2,253 defenders killed (2012-2024); 146 in 2024
- Indigenous disproportionality: 33% of victims, 6% of population (5.5x)
- Impunity crisis: 94.8% of killings in Colombia go unprosecuted
- Legal recognition gap: Only 11% of Indigenous lands formally recognized
- Carbon storage: 340 million tonnes CO2 net removal (Amazon 2001-2021)

**5.2 FRONTLINE COMMUNITIES**

- Cancer Alley: 700x national cancer risk in 90% Black Louisiana parish
- Flint: 7 years, 9 charged, ZERO criminal convictions
- Climate displacement: 45.8 million in 2024 (record); 216 million projected by 2050
- PFAS disparities: 92-95% minority exposure vs. 76% white (New Jersey)
- Heat islands: 12.6°F hotter in formerly redlined neighborhoods
- Global sacrifice zones: DRC cobalt (40,000 children), Niger Delta, Chile lithium

### Core Thesis

**Environmental collapse has human faces.** The Sixth Mass Extinction is not an abstract planetary process but a violent reality imposed on specific communities by identifiable systems of power. Indigenous peoples are killed for defending forests that store 340 million tonnes of carbon. Children in Cancer Alley breathe air with 700x the national cancer risk. 40,000 children in the DRC mine cobalt for smartphones and electric vehicles. This is not accidental but structural - **privatized profits, racialized and colonized ecological debt.** Indigenous peoples and frontline communities share a struggle against common enemies: extractive capitalism and complicit states. The solution is not charity but justice: reparations, land back, and systemic transformation.

## SECTION ARCHITECTURE & INTEGRATION LOGIC

### The Shared Struggle Framework

```
EXTRACTIVE CAPITALISM (Section 4.0)
    ↓
Requires sacrifice zones for profit
    ↓
CORPORATE POWER (4.2) selects locations
    ↓
Based on: race, colonization, poverty, political weakness
    ↓
GOVERNMENT FAILURE (4.3) enables extraction
    ↓
Through: subsidies, impunity, regulatory capture
    ↓
INDIGENOUS PEOPLES (5.1)              FRONTLINE COMMUNITIES (5.2)
    ↓                                     ↓
Superior stewardship                  Toxic burden
but systematic violence               but no accountability
    ↓                                     ↓
SAME ENEMIES: Extractive industries + Complicit states
    ↓
SAME SOLUTION: Justice, reparations, systemic transformation
```

### Cross-Cutting Themes

**STRUCTURAL RACISM, NOT ISOLATED INCIDENTS**

- Cancer Alley is not a failure but a feature
- Flint's zero convictions = system functioning
- Pattern: Communities without political power = sacrifice zones

**STATE AND CORPORATE COMPLICITY**

- Violence against defenders: Mining, cattle, agribusiness industries
- Toxic burden: Industrial facilities sited in Black/Brown neighborhoods
- Climate displacement: Emissions from wealthy → impacts on poor
- Pattern: Perpetrators protected, victims blamed

**IMPUNITY AS STRUCTURAL**

- Colombia: 94.8% impunity for defender killings
- Flint: 7 years, 9 charged, ZERO convictions
- Trump 2025: DOJ dropped Cancer Alley case
- Pattern: Legal system protects capital, not communities

**WORKING-CLASS SOLIDARITY**

- NOT nation vs. nation (Americans vs. Bangladeshis)
- NOT race vs. race (without class analysis)
- BUT global elite vs. working people everywhere
- Pattern: Class warfare disguised as geography

**RESISTANCE, NOT VICTIMIZATION**

- Indigenous defenders: Active resistors (2,253 killed fighting)
- Frontline communities: Organizing, litigating, demanding justice
- Legal victories: KlimaSeniorinnen, ICJ Advisory Opinion
- Pattern: Honor the fight, not just the suffering

**JUSTICE, NOT CHARITY**

- Not "helping the less fortunate"
- But reparations for extraction debt
- Land back for stolen territories
- Pattern: Rights-based, not needs-based framing

### 5.1 Indigenous Peoples & Traditional Ecological Knowledge

**Target Output:** 8,000-10,000 word article

## ETHICAL LANDMINES TO AVOID

### Indigenous Peoples (5.1)

- ❌ "Noble savage" tropes
- ❌ "Pristine wilderness" myth
- ❌ Conservation over sovereignty
- ❌ Victimization without resistance
- ❌ "80% biodiversity" unsupported claim
- ✅ Sovereignty-centered, resistance-highlighted

### Frontline Communities (5.2)

- ❌ "Average Americans" (includes comfortable middle class)
- ❌ Nation vs. nation framing
- ❌ Charity/savior narratives
- ❌ Individual choices blame
- ❌ Environmental racism as "isolated incidents"
- ✅ Structural racism, working-class solidarity

### Both Sections

- ❌ Generic statistics without human faces
- ❌ Unnamed perpetrators
- ❌ False hope without structural analysis
- ❌ Reform framing without transformation
- ✅ Named victims, named corporations, justice framing

## NOTES FOR FUTURE SELF

### Remember

1. **Same struggle, same enemy.** Indigenous peoples in the Amazon and Black residents in Cancer Alley share common enemies: extractive capitalism and complicit states.

1. **Working-class solidarity is the frame.** NOT nation vs. nation. NOT charity. Global elite vs. working people everywhere.

1. **Name the dead.** 2,253 defenders killed. Maria de Fátima Muniz. Gerardo Keimari. Say their names.

1. **Name the perpetrators.** Mining companies. Denka. The state of Michigan. The Trump administration.

1. **Zero convictions matters.** Flint: 7 years, 9 charged, ZERO convictions. This IS the system functioning.

1. **The "80% biodiversity" claim is DEAD.** Use: 37% natural lands, 33% intact forests, 66-83% lower deforestation.

1. **Climate displacement is NOW.** 45.8 million in 2024. Record year. Not future projection.

1. **Trump 2025 rollback shows:** Environmental justice gains are reversible. Reform is insufficient.

1. **Justice, not charity.** Reparations. Land back. Systemic transformation.

1. **This enables Section 10.0.** Without environmental justice, no genuine transformation is possible.
