✒ Description:
    This blueprint guides creation of a comprehensive article documenting environmental
    racism as structural (not accidental), climate displacement as class warfare, and
    global sacrifice zones as features of extractive capitalism - covering Cancer Alley
    (700x cancer risk), Flint (zero criminal convictions), climate displacement (45.8M
    in 2024), and global patterns of waste colonialism and toxic burden.

✒ Key Features:
    - Structural Racism Analysis: Environmental racism as design, not accident
    - Working-Class Solidarity Frame: Black/Brown/Indigenous/poor white ALL victims
    - Zero Criminal Accountability: Flint - 7 years, 9 charged, ZERO convictions
    - Cancer Alley: 700x national cancer risk (Johns Hopkins 2025 verified)
    - Climate Displacement: 45.8M in 2024 (IDMC record); 216M projected by 2050
    - PFAS Disparities: 92-95% minority exposure vs. 76% white (New Jersey)
    - Heat Islands: 12.6°F hotter in formerly redlined neighborhoods
    - Global Sacrifice Zones: DRC cobalt (40,000 children), Niger Delta, Chile lithium
    - Trump 2025 Rollback: EPA EJ programs terminated, DOJ dropped Cancer Alley case
    - Life Expectancy Gaps: 20.7 years difference by Chicago ZIP code

✒ Critical Framing Standards:
    - Environmental racism as STRUCTURAL, not isolated incidents
    - Working-class solidarity (all victims of elite extraction)
    - State and corporate complicity, not individual bad actors
    - NOT charity narrative - JUSTICE framing only
    - NO "average Americans" (includes comfortable middle class)
    - Frame as class warfare: global elite vs. working people everywhere
    - Trapped vs. complicit distinction (infrastructure constraint vs. choice)

✒ Usage Instructions:
    This research blueprint provides a 4-week execution framework for creating an
    8,000-10,000 word article documenting environmental racism as structural violence,
    climate displacement as mass crisis, and global sacrifice zones as extraction
    features. Use Week 1 for US case studies, Week 2 for climate displacement, Week 3
    for global sacrifice zones and resistance, Week 4 for composition and integration.

✒ Integration Points:
    - Builds on MB_SS-5.1 (Indigenous Peoples) - shared struggle framework
    - Links to MB_SS-4.2 (Corporate Power) - same corporations, different victims
    - Links to MB_SS-4.3 (Government Failure) - zero accountability, reversed EJ policy
    - Links to MB_SS-4.4 (Consumption Inequality) - elite consumption drives sacrifice zones
    - Critical for MB_PS-10.0 (Synthesis) - environmental justice as precondition

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

### Article Focus

This research blueprint guides creation of a comprehensive article examining **environmental racism as structural violence** - documenting Cancer Alley's 700x cancer risk, Flint's zero criminal convictions, the record 45.8 million climate displacements in 2024, and global sacrifice zones from DRC cobalt mines to Chile lithium extraction. The article centers working-class solidarity across race and nation while exposing state and corporate complicity.

### Target Output

- **Stand-alone article:** 8,000-10,000 words
- **Structural racism analysis:** Environmental racism as design, not accident
- **Working-class solidarity frame:** Black, Brown, Indigenous, poor white ALL victims
- **Climate displacement documentation:** 45.8M in 2024; 216M projected by 2050
- **Global sacrifice zones:** DRC (40,000 children mining), Niger Delta, Chile, tar sands

### Core Thesis

Environmental racism is not a series of isolated incidents but structural violence embedded in capitalist extraction. When Denka's Louisiana plant creates cancer risk 700x the national average in a 90% Black parish, when Flint's poisoning of children produces zero criminal convictions after 7 years, when 45.8 million people are displaced by climate disasters in a single year (2024), when 40,000 children mine cobalt in the DRC for batteries in wealthy consumers' phones and cars - these are not accidents. They are the system functioning as designed: privatizing profits while racializing and externalizing ecological debt. Environmental justice is not charity but reparations; not reform but systemic transformation.

### Critical Framing Note

**This is class warfare, not nation vs. nation.** Working-class Americans in Cancer Alley and Appalachia are victims alongside frontline communities in Bangladesh and the Niger Delta. The enemy is extractive capitalism and complicit states, not "average Americans" (a statistical lie that includes the comfortable middle class). Frame as **global elite vs. working people everywhere.**

## CROSS-REFERENCE INTEGRATION

### Backward Links (Dependencies)

**From Section 4.0 (Economic Systems):**

- 4.2 Corporate Power: Same corporations profit from sacrifice zones
- 4.3 Governmental Failure: State impunity for environmental crimes
- 4.4 Consumption Inequality: Elite consumption drives extraction

**From Section 5.1 (Indigenous Peoples):**

- Shared struggle framework
- Same enemies (extractive industries, complicit governments)
- Climate displacement affects Indigenous peoples disproportionately

---

### Forward Links (What This Enables)

**To Section 8.0 (Failed Solutions):**

- 8.1 Technological Optimism: "Green" transition still creates sacrifice zones
- 8.2 Conservation Insufficiency: Community displacement for conservation

**To Section 10.0 (Synthesis):**

- 10.2 Survival Question: Environmental justice as precondition
- 10.3 What Actually Required: Reparations, systemic transformation
- Working-class solidarity as political foundation

## CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS

This Article Succeeds If:

1. **Structural racism is crystal clear:** Reader understands environmental racism as design, not accident

1. **Working-class solidarity prevails:** Black, Brown, Indigenous, poor white framed as shared struggle

1. **Accountability failure is documented:** Flint's zero convictions, Denka's dropped case

1. **Climate displacement is quantified:** 45.8 million (2024), 216 million (2050) with regional detail

1. **Global sacrifice zones are connected:** DRC cobalt → phones; Niger Delta oil → profits; lithium → EVs

1. **Trump 2025 rollback is documented:** What was gained, what was lost

1. **Resistance is highlighted:** Not just victimization but community organizing and legal victories

1. **Integration is seamless:** Links to Sections 4.0, 5.1, 8.0, 10.0 established

1. **Justice framing prevails:** Reparations, not charity; transformation, not reform

1. **No false hope:** Gains are reversible without structural change; truth over comfort

## NOTES FOR FUTURE SELF

### Remember

1. **This is class warfare.** Global elite vs. working people everywhere. Not Americans vs. Bangladeshis.

1. **Structural racism, not isolated incidents.** Cancer Alley is not an accident. Flint is not a failure. This is the system functioning.

1. **Zero convictions matters.** Flint: 7 years, 9 charged, ZERO convictions. Say it explicitly. Name the impunity.

1. **Trump 2025 rollback is critical.** Document what Biden built ($83B), what Trump destroyed. Gains are not permanent.

1. **Connect to consumption.** DRC children mining cobalt for Western phones and EVs. Chile lithium for "green" transition. Name the supply chain.

1. **Climate displacement is NOW.** 45.8 million in 2024. Record year. Not future prediction.

1. **Climate gentrification is class war.** New Orleans: 100,000 Black residents permanently displaced. Miami: working-class displaced by wealthy adaptation.

1. **PFAS disparities are verified.** 92-95% minority vs. 76% white in New Jersey. First nationwide assessment confirmed structural pattern.

1. **Connect to Section 5.1.** Indigenous peoples and frontline communities share struggle. Same enemies.

1. **Justice, not charity.** Reparations framework. Systemic transformation. Not helping "the less fortunate."
