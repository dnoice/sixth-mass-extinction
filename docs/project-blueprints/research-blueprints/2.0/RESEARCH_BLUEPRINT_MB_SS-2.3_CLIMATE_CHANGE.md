## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

### Article Focus

This research blueprint guides the creation of a comprehensive article examining **"How does climate change act as an extinction accelerant?"** by documenting how rapid warming multiplies threats to already-stressed species, triggers ecosystem tipping points, and creates cascading failures across interconnected systems.

### Core Thesis

Climate change functions as a threat multiplier and extinction accelerant—not merely another stressor but a force that amplifies habitat loss, disrupts evolved relationships, triggers ecosystem tipping points, and operates at speeds that exceed species' adaptive capacity, with 2024 marking the crossing of critical thresholds including the first year above 1.5°C and the first confirmed ecosystem tipping point (coral reefs).

---

## RESEARCH OBJECTIVES

### Primary Questions to Answer

1. **Why is 2024 significant for climate and biodiversity? (1.5°C breach, coral tipping point)**
1. **How does climate change accelerate extinction beyond direct temperature effects?**
1. **What ecosystem tipping points have been crossed or are imminent?**
1. **How do climate impacts compound with other extinction drivers?**
1. **What is the evidence for climate attribution to species extinctions?**

### Secondary Questions

1. How do species respond to rapid climate change (range shifts, phenological changes)?
1. What are the ocean-specific climate impacts (acidification, warming, deoxygenation)?
1. How do extreme weather events cause mass mortality?
1. What is the relationship between warming rate and extinction risk?
1. Are climate impacts reversible on human timescales?

## COMMON PITFALLS TO AVOID

### Methodological Errors

- ❌ Confusing single-year temperature with long-term Paris Agreement metric
- ❌ Conflating weather events with climate trends
- ❌ Ignoring confidence levels and uncertainties
- ❌ Treating all species as equally vulnerable
- ❌ Missing synergistic effects (treating stressors as additive)
- ❌ Underestimating lag times in responses

### Framing Mistakes

- ❌ Climate determinism (ignoring other extinction drivers)
- ❌ Hopelessness (missing mitigation potential)
- ❌ False precision (unwarranted certainty in projections)
- ❌ Techno-optimism (ignoring irreversibility)
- ❌ Missing acceleration (static vs. dynamic threat)

### Research Gaps

- ❌ Using pre-2024 temperature data
- ❌ Missing 2024 extreme events
- ❌ Outdated attribution science
- ❌ Ignoring recent tipping point research
