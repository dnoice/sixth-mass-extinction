## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

### Article Focus

This research blueprint guides the creation of a comprehensive article examining **"What are the permanent costs of resource extraction?"** by documenting how extraction industries create complete ecosystem elimination zones that persist for centuries or permanently, with devastating health impacts on frontline communities.

### Core Thesis

Resource extraction—from mountaintop removal to deep-sea mining—creates permanent "sacrifice zones" where complete ecosystem elimination occurs, recovery timescales extend to centuries or become impossible, and disproportionately impacts Indigenous and poor communities who bear multi-generational health costs.

## COMMON PITFALLS TO AVOID

### Methodological Errors

- ❌ Underestimating permanence of damage
- ❌ Accepting industry "reclamation" claims without verification
- ❌ Ignoring multi-generational health impacts
- ❌ Vague corporate attribution ("the industry" vs. naming Shell, Chevron)
- ❌ Missing deep-sea mining as emerging catastrophic threat
- ❌ Overlooking rare earth toxic costs of "green" transition

### Framing Mistakes

- ❌ Presenting extraction as necessary evil
- ❌ False equivalence between jobs and permanent ecosystem destruction
- ❌ Ignoring environmental justice dimensions
- ❌ Technological optimism about cleanup/restoration
- ❌ Minimizing community health testimonies

### Research Gaps

- ❌ Relying on outdated statistics (use 2023-2025 data)
- ❌ Missing sacrifice zone case studies
- ❌ Insufficient corporate supply chain tracing
- ❌ Ignoring emerging threats (deep-sea, rare earth expansion)
