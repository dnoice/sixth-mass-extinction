✒ Description:
    This blueprint guides creation of a comprehensive article documenting the
    systemic causation of mass extinction: how interlocking systems of capitalism,
    colonialism, industrialization, and extractivism have transgressed planetary
    boundaries and driven biodiversity collapse. Integrates IPBES Transformative
    Change Assessment 2024 findings with 2023-2025 research on systemic drivers.

✒ Key Features:
    - IPBES 2024 Framework: Three underlying causes of biodiversity loss identified
    - System Interconnection: Capitalism → Industrialization → Colonialism → Collapse
    - Externalization Mechanisms: Costs displaced to nature, future, vulnerable
    - Institutionalized Short-Termism: Quarterly/electoral vs. geological timescales
    - Individual vs. Systemic: Why personal action cannot substitute for system change
    - Corporate Accountability: 57 entities = 80% fossil CO₂ (2016-2022)
    - Planetary Boundaries: 7 of 9 transgressed - system functioning "normally"

✒ Critical Framing Standards:
    - This is NOT a moral failure - it is a structural feature of the system
    - Extinction is the system working as designed, not a malfunction
    - "Growth imperative" is architectural, not optional
    - Colonial extraction patterns persist in contemporary form
    - Individual blame-shifting is itself a systemic strategy
    - Externalization is a feature, not a bug

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

### Article Focus

This research blueprint guides creation of a comprehensive synthesis article documenting **systemic causation of the sixth mass extinction** - demonstrating that biodiversity collapse is not an accident, policy failure, or unintended consequence, but rather the **predictable outcome of systems designed for extraction, accumulation, and externalization**. Drawing from the IPBES Transformative Change Assessment (December 2024) and integrating research from Sections 1-9, this article establishes why **systemic change is required, not incremental reform**.

### Target Output

- **Stand-alone synthesis article:** 8,000-10,000 words
- **System architecture analysis:** Capitalism → Industrialization → Colonialism → Boundaries transgressed
- **IPBES 2024 Integration:** Three underlying causes, five key challenges, transformative change framework
- **Corporate attribution:** 57 entities = 80% fossil CO₂, agricultural commodity chains
- **Externalization documentation:** How costs are displaced to nature, future, vulnerable
- **Individual vs. Systemic:** Why blame-shifting is itself a systemic strategy

### Core Thesis

**The sixth mass extinction is not a failure of the system - it is the system succeeding at what it was designed to do.** Capitalism requires continuous growth in a finite biosphere; colonialism established extraction patterns that persist today; industrialization mechanized the conversion of living systems to commodities; and corporate power has captured governance to prevent reform. The IPBES Transformative Change Assessment (2024) identifies three underlying causes of biodiversity loss: **disconnection from nature and domination over nature/people, inequitable concentration of power and wealth, and prioritization of short-term individual gains**. These are not bugs to be fixed but features of systems designed for accumulation. With **7 of 9 planetary boundaries transgressed** (2025), the collision between infinite growth and finite planet has moved from theory to measured reality. The same 57 fossil fuel producers responsible for 80% of CO₂ emissions (2016-2022) continue to operate because the system protects them. Individual action cannot substitute for systemic transformation - and blame-shifting to consumers is itself a corporate strategy to deflect accountability. Until the system changes, extinction will continue because **extinction is what the system produces**.

### Critical Framing Note

**This article must avoid moralizing.** The goal is not to condemn "greed" or "human nature" - it is to document system architecture. Capitalism is not evil; it is a system with specific structural requirements (growth, accumulation, externalization) that are incompatible with biosphere stability. The people operating within this system are constrained by its rules. The question is not "who is bad?" but "why does this system produce extinction?" This framing enables productive discussion of alternatives rather than performative blame.

## QUALITY CONTROL FRAMEWORK

### Fact-Checking Protocol

**Tier 1 Claims (Critical - VERIFY ALL):**

- [ ] 7 of 9 planetary boundaries transgressed (Richardson et al. 2023 + 2025 update)
- [ ] 57 entities = 80% fossil CO₂ 2016-2022 (Carbon Majors 2024)
- [ ] $7 trillion fossil fuel subsidies (IMF 2023)
- [ ] -40% natural capital per capita 1992-2014 (Dasgupta Review)
- [ ] $125-140T ecosystem services (Costanza et al. / Dasgupta)
- [ ] IPBES 2024 three underlying causes (direct from assessment)

**Tier 2 Claims (Important):**

- [ ] 86% projected biodiversity loss from agriculture
- [ ] 101 experts from 42 countries (IPBES 2024)
- [ ] $10T opportunity + 395M jobs (IPBES 2024)
- [ ] Colonial extraction pattern documentation
- [ ] Individual vs. systemic action evidence

**REJECTED Claims (DO NOT USE):**

- ❌ Simplistic "greed" explanations
- ❌ Human nature as cause
- ❌ Individual blame without systemic context
- ❌ Capitalism as moral failure vs. structural analysis

---

### Nuance Requirements

**For systemic causation claims:**

- Document system architecture, not moral condemnation
- Show structural requirements, not optional choices
- Acknowledge constrained agency within systems
- Connect to material conditions, not ideology alone

**For corporate attribution:**

- Focus on structural position and behavior, not individual executives
- Document systemic protection mechanisms
- Show governance capture as structural, not conspiratorial
- Connect to broader system dynamics

**For IPBES integration:**

- Use official terminology and definitions
- Acknowledge political process of assessment
- Connect science to policy implications
- Show diversity of perspectives within framework

## CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS

### This Article Succeeds If

1. **System architecture is clear:** Reader understands how capitalism, colonialism, industrialization interlock

1. **IPBES 2024 is integrated:** Three underlying causes, five challenges, five strategies documented

1. **Externalization is tangible:** Where costs go, who bears them

1. **Corporate attribution is specific:** Named entities, quantified responsibility

1. **Temporal mismatch is understood:** Why short-termism is structural

1. **Individual vs. systemic is clear:** Why personal action is insufficient without system change

1. **Framing avoids moralizing:** Structure, not "greed" or "human nature"

1. **Connection to transformation is made:** What must change, not just what's wrong

1. **Evidence is rigorous:** Every claim sourced and verified

1. **Integration works:** Synthesizes Sections 1-9, enables 10.2-10.4

## NOTES FOR FUTURE SELF

### Remember

1. **This is synthesis, not repetition.** Draw from all previous sections but create new understanding.

1. **Structural analysis, not moral condemnation.** The goal is understanding, not blame.

1. **IPBES 2024 is the anchor.** First intergovernmental body to directly address power asymmetries.

1. **7 of 9 boundaries is the metric.** This is measured, not speculative.

1. **57 entities = 80% is the attribution.** Responsibility is concentrated and documented.

1. **$7T subsidies is the capture.** Government protecting what it should regulate.

1. **Individual blame is corporate strategy.** Document BP inventing "carbon footprint."

1. **Transformation is the implication.** If system causes extinction, system must change.

1. **Connect forward to 10.2-10.4.** This establishes why systemic change is required; those sections address what and why not.

1. **End with clarity, not despair.** Understanding system architecture is prerequisite to changing it.

**Signature:** ︻デ═─── ✦ ✦ ✦ | Aim Twice, Shoot Once!

**"The sixth mass extinction is not a failure of the system - it is the system succeeding at what it was designed to do. Capitalism requires continuous growth in a finite biosphere; colonialism established extraction patterns that persist today; industrialization mechanized the conversion of living systems to commodities; and corporate power has captured governance to prevent reform."**

**"The IPBES Transformative Change Assessment (2024) identifies three underlying causes: disconnection from nature and domination, inequitable concentration of power and wealth, and prioritization of short-term gains. These are not bugs to be fixed but features of systems designed for accumulation."**

**"With 7 of 9 planetary boundaries transgressed, 57 fossil fuel producers responsible for 80% of CO₂ emissions, and $7 trillion in subsidies protecting the destroyers, the system is functioning exactly as designed. Until the system changes, extinction will continue - because extinction is what the system produces."**
