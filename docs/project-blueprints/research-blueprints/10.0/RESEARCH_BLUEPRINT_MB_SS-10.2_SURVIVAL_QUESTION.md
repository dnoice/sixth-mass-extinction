✒ Description:
    This blueprint guides creation of a comprehensive article documenting the
    existential implications of biodiversity collapse for human civilization:
    ecosystem service dependencies, cascading failure pathways, food system
    vulnerabilities, climate refugee projections, and the survival question.
    Synthesizes 2023-2025 research on civilization-biosphere coupling.

✒ Key Features:
    - Ecosystem Service Dependence: $125-140T annually, 50%+ GDP nature-dependent
    - Food System Vulnerabilities: Pollinators, soil collapse, monocultures
    - Cascading Failure Pathways: How biodiversity loss triggers civilizational crises
    - Climate Refugees: 200M-1.2B by 2050 projections
    - Historical Precedent: Past civilizations collapsed from environmental degradation
    - Survival Question: Can human civilization survive without functional ecosystems?

✒ Critical Framing Standards:
    - Human survival is inseparable from ecosystem survival
    - Civilization depends on services we have not paid for
    - "Economy" is a subset of "ecology," not vice versa
    - Food security is biodiversity security
    - Climate and biodiversity crises are one crisis
    - This is existential, not merely economic

✒ Usage Instructions:
    This research blueprint provides a 4-week execution framework for creating an
    8,000-10,000 word article. Use Week 1 for ecosystem service dependency analysis,
    Week 2 for cascading failure documentation, Week 3 for food/water/displacement
    projections, Week 4 for composition.

✒ Integration Points:
    - Builds on MB_SS-10.1 (Systemic Causation) - the system threatens its own base
    - Synthesizes MB_SS-3.2 (Ecosystem Service Failures) - specific failure modes
    - Synthesizes MB_SS-6.1 (Functional Diversity) - what we need vs. losing
    - Synthesizes MB_SS-7.2 (Irreversible Losses) - cascading collapse pathways

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

### Article Focus

This research blueprint guides creation of a comprehensive synthesis article documenting **the existential implications of biodiversity collapse for human civilization** - demonstrating that human survival is inseparable from ecosystem survival, that civilization depends on ecological services it has systematically degraded, and that cascading failures are not hypothetical but already underway. This article answers the question: **Can human civilization survive the sixth mass extinction?**

### Target Output

- **Stand-alone synthesis article:** 8,000-10,000 words
- **Ecosystem service dependency:** $125-140T annually, 50%+ GDP nature-dependent
- **Food system vulnerabilities:** Pollinators, soil degradation, monoculture risks
- **Cascading failure documentation:** How biodiversity loss triggers civilizational crises
- **Climate refugee projections:** 200M-1.2B displaced by 2050
- **Survival probability analysis:** Evidence-based assessment of existential risk

### Core Thesis

**Human civilization exists within the biosphere, not above it.** We depend absolutely on ecosystem services worth $125-140 trillion annually - more than global GDP - yet we have systematically degraded the systems that provide them. **Over 50% of global GDP is moderately or highly dependent on nature**, but this dependency is invisible to economic models that treat ecosystems as externalities rather than foundations. With **40% of pollinators facing extinction**, **24 billion tonnes of soil lost annually**, and **73% decline in wildlife populations in 50 years**, the material basis of civilization is eroding. Projections indicate **200 million to 1.2 billion climate refugees by 2050**, food systems facing catastrophic disruption, and cascading failures across interconnected systems. Historical precedent shows that every civilization that degraded its ecological base has collapsed - the Maya, Easter Island, Rome. We are conducting this experiment globally. The question is not whether biodiversity loss will affect human survival, but **whether we will change course before cascading collapse becomes irreversible**.

### Critical Framing Note

**This article must avoid both denial and despair.** The goal is not to predict apocalypse with certainty - complex systems resist prediction - but to document the material dependencies that are being severed and the cascading risks they create. We don't know the exact timing or sequence of collapse, but we know the direction: **a less biodiverse planet is a less habitable planet for humans**. This is not alarmism; it is following the evidence.

## QUALITY CONTROL FRAMEWORK

### Fact-Checking Protocol

**Tier 1 Claims (Critical - VERIFY ALL):**

- [ ] $125-140 trillion ecosystem services annually (Costanza et al. / Dasgupta)
- [ ] 50%+ GDP nature-dependent (WEF/Global Futures)
- [ ] 73% wildlife decline 1970-2020 (WWF Living Planet 2024)
- [ ] 40% invertebrate pollinators at risk (IPBES/IUCN)
- [ ] 24 billion tonnes soil lost annually (UNCCD/FAO)
- [ ] 200M-1.2B climate refugees by 2050 (World Bank/IEP)
- [ ] 117 million currently displaced (UNHCR 2025)

**Tier 2 Claims (Important):**

- [ ] 87 crops dependent on pollinators (FAO)
- [ ] 21/37 major aquifers declining (NASA/GRACE)
- [ ] Historical collapse environmental factors
- [ ] Cascade pathway documentation
- [ ] Tipping point interaction evidence

**REJECTED Claims (DO NOT USE):**

- ❌ Certainty about collapse timing
- ❌ Extinction of human species claims
- ❌ Near-term civilizational extinction predictions
- ❌ Single-cause collapse explanations

### Nuance Requirements

**For ecosystem service claims:**

- Acknowledge valuation methodology limitations
- Show range of estimates where available
- Connect to material dependencies, not just dollar values
- Distinguish market and non-market services

**For collapse projections:**

- Present scenarios, not certainties
- Acknowledge complex system unpredictability
- Show evidence base for projections
- Distinguish regional from global risks

**For historical comparisons:**

- Acknowledge historiographical debates
- Show multiple causal factors
- Note limitations of analogies
- Highlight both similarities and differences

## CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS

### This Article Succeeds If

1. **Dependence is tangible:** Reader understands civilization cannot exist without ecosystems

1. **Cascades are clear:** How local failures become global crises

1. **Food system is mapped:** Pollinators, soil, fisheries, diversity vulnerabilities

1. **Displacement is quantified:** 200M-1.2B with evidence base

1. **History is instructive:** Past collapses illuminate present risks

1. **Probability is assessed:** Evidence-based survival analysis

1. **Framing is balanced:** Neither denial nor despair

1. **Urgency is conveyed:** Without apocalypticism

1. **Evidence is rigorous:** Every claim sourced

1. **Integration works:** Connects to 10.1, 10.3, 10.4

## NOTES FOR FUTURE SELF

### Remember

1. **This is about material dependencies.** Not ideology or politics - what civilization physically needs.

1. **$125-140T is the anchor.** Ecosystem services exceed global GDP - and we're degrading them.

1. **50%+ GDP is the hook.** Even by capitalist metrics, nature is foundation.

1. **73% decline is measured.** This is not speculation - it's monitoring data.

1. **Cascades are the mechanism.** Document how local failures become global.

1. **200M-1.2B is the human face.** Displacement is not abstract.

1. **History rhymes.** Every collapsed civilization degraded its ecological base.

1. **Probability, not certainty.** Document risks, not predictions.

1. **Connect forward.** This establishes stakes; 10.3 addresses response, 10.4 addresses failure.

1. **End with stakes, not despair.** Understanding dependency is prerequisite to protection.

**Signature:** ︻デ═─── ✦ ✦ ✦ | Aim Twice, Shoot Once!

**"Human civilization exists within the biosphere, not above it. We depend absolutely on ecosystem services worth $125-140 trillion annually - more than global GDP - yet we have systematically degraded the systems that provide them."**

**"Over 50% of global GDP is moderately or highly dependent on nature, but this dependency is invisible to economic models that treat ecosystems as externalities rather than foundations."**

**"With 40% of pollinators facing extinction, 24 billion tonnes of soil lost annually, and 73% decline in wildlife populations in 50 years, the material basis of civilization is eroding. The question is not whether biodiversity loss will affect human survival, but whether we will change course before cascading collapse becomes irreversible."**
