✒ Description:
    This blueprint guides creation of a comprehensive article documenting what would
    actually be required to halt the sixth mass extinction: immediate interventions,
    economic transformation, political transformation, consumption reduction, and
    long-term restoration. Integrates IPBES 2024 transformative change framework
    with 2023-2025 research on degrowth, post-growth economics, and systemic change.

✒ Key Features:
    - IPBES 2024 Five Strategies: Biocultural diversity, mainstreaming, economic
      transformation, governance reform, value shift
    - Immediate Actions: Halt deforestation, end fossil fuels, protect 50% of Earth
    - Economic Transformation: Beyond growth capitalism, degrowth, wealth redistribution
    - Political Transformation: End corporate capture, rights of nature, binding agreements
    - Consumption Reduction: Wealthy nations reduce 75%+, eliminate luxury emissions
    - Long-term: Large-scale restoration, cultural transformation

✒ Critical Framing Standards:
    - This is what science says is required, not what is politically feasible
    - Gap between required and delivered is the measure of failure
    - "Realistic" solutions are unrealistic if they don't match scale of crisis
    - Incremental change within the system is insufficient - system must change
    - Document honestly: This is the prescription, regardless of whether patient will take it

✒ Usage Instructions:
    This research blueprint provides a 4-week execution framework for creating an
    8,000-10,000 word article. Use Week 1 for IPBES framework and immediate actions,
    Week 2 for economic transformation, Week 3 for political transformation and
    consumption reduction, Week 4 for composition.

✒ Integration Points:
    - Builds on MB_SS-10.1 (Systemic Causation) - what must change
    - Builds on MB_SS-10.2 (Survival Question) - why change is necessary
    - Foundation for MB_SS-10.4 (Tragic Conclusion) - why it likely won't happen
    - Synthesizes MB_SS-8.0 (Failed Solutions) - why current approaches fail
    - Draws from MB_SS-4.1-4.4 (Economic Systems) - what must be transformed

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

### Article Focus

This research blueprint guides creation of a comprehensive synthesis article documenting **what would actually be required to halt the sixth mass extinction and preserve human civilization** - not what is "realistic" within current political constraints, but what science indicates is necessary. This article serves as the honest prescription, regardless of whether the patient will take the medicine. The gap between what is required and what is delivered is the measure of collective failure.

### Target Output

- **Stand-alone synthesis article:** 8,000-10,000 words
- **IPBES 2024 Transformation Framework:** Five strategies for systemic change
- **Immediate actions:** Halt deforestation, end fossil fuels, protect 50% of Earth
- **Economic transformation:** Beyond GDP growth, degrowth for wealthy nations
- **Political transformation:** End corporate capture, binding agreements, rights of nature
- **Consumption reduction:** 75%+ reduction for wealthy nations, eliminate luxury emissions

### Core Thesis

**The scale of the crisis demands transformation, not reform.** What is required to halt the sixth mass extinction and preserve a habitable planet is not incremental adjustment but **fundamental system-wide change in how we produce, consume, govern, and relate to nature**. The IPBES Transformative Change Assessment (2024) identifies five strategies: conserving biocultural diversity, mainstreaming biodiversity, transforming economic systems, reforming governance, and shifting societal values. Implementing these requires **ending fossil fuel use by mid-century, protecting at least 30-50% of Earth's surface, halving emissions by 2030, and transitioning beyond growth-dependent capitalism** - especially in wealthy nations that must reduce consumption by 75%+. Every projection of maintaining current systems shows continued collapse. Every pathway to survival requires system change. **"Realistic" solutions that don't match the scale of the crisis are unrealistic** - they merely make failure sound acceptable. This article documents what would actually work, based on scientific consensus, regardless of political palatability. The gap between this prescription and what governments deliver is the measure of how seriously they take survival.

### Critical Framing Note

**This article is prescription, not prediction.** The goal is not to argue that transformation will happen - Section 10.4 addresses why it likely won't - but to document clearly what would be required if it did. This establishes the benchmark against which all policy must be measured. When governments announce "ambitious" climate targets that don't match what's required, this article provides the framework to call out the gap. "We are doing our best" is only true if "our best" matches what's necessary.

## QUALITY CONTROL FRAMEWORK

### Fact-Checking Protocol

**Tier 1 Claims (Critical - VERIFY ALL):**

- [ ] IPBES five strategies (direct from assessment)
- [ ] -40% to -55% emissions by 2030 (UNEP/IPCC)
- [ ] 30% by 2030 / 50% long-term protection (GBF/Half-Earth)
- [ ] $7 trillion fossil subsidies (IMF 2023)
- [ ] $200 billion/year biodiversity finance needed (GBF)
- [ ] Top 10% emit 50% CO₂ (World Inequality Report)
- [ ] 16.44% terrestrial, 7.74% marine current protection

**Tier 2 Claims (Important):**

- [ ] 75% material footprint reduction requirement
- [ ] Decoupling evidence absence
- [ ] Degrowth policy specifics
- [ ] Rights of nature legal developments
- [ ] Consumption reduction by category

**REJECTED Claims (DO NOT USE):**

- ❌ "We can grow our way out of crisis"
- ❌ Technology alone will solve it
- ❌ Individual action is sufficient
- ❌ Voluntary commitments are adequate

### Nuance Requirements

**For transformation claims:**

- Distinguish what science requires from what politics delivers
- Acknowledge uncertainty in pathways (not in direction)
- Show evidence base for each requirement
- Address equity in burden distribution

**For degrowth claims:**

- Specify wealthy nations vs. global application
- Distinguish necessary degrowth from austerity
- Show wellbeing evidence
- Address employment concerns

**For political transformation:**

- Acknowledge systemic barriers
- Don't underestimate difficulty
- But also don't use difficulty as excuse for inaction
- Show what IS possible with political will

## CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS

### This Article Succeeds If

1. **Requirements are clear:** Reader knows exactly what's needed

1. **Scale is conveyed:** Transformation, not reform

1. **IPBES framework is documented:** Five strategies, implementation needs

1. **Economic transformation is specific:** What must change, how

1. **Political requirements are named:** End corporate capture, binding agreements

1. **Consumption targets are quantified:** 75% reduction, luxury emissions

1. **Gap is visible:** Required vs. delivered clearly contrasted

1. **Framing is honest:** Prescription, not prediction

1. **Evidence is rigorous:** Every requirement sourced

1. **Integration works:** Builds on 10.1-10.2, sets up 10.4

## NOTES FOR FUTURE SELF

### Remember

1. **This is prescription, not prediction.** Document what would work, regardless of whether it will happen.

1. **IPBES 2024 is the anchor.** Five strategies from intergovernmental scientific body.

1. **Transformation, not reform.** Incremental change within system = failure.

1. **Gap is the metric.** Distance between required and delivered = measure of failure.

1. **Degrowth is not optional.** Decoupling is debunked; wealthy nations must reduce.

1. **Equity matters.** Top 10% emit 50%; reduction must target them.

1. **30-50% protection.** Current 16.44%/7.74% is catastrophically insufficient.

1. **$7T subsidies.** Eliminating them = 43% emissions reduction, 1.6M lives saved.

1. **Connect to 10.4.** This establishes what's required; 10.4 explains why it won't happen.

1. **End with benchmark, not hope.** This is the standard; hold governments to it.

**Signature:** ︻デ═─── ✦ ✦ ✦ | Aim Twice, Shoot Once!

**"The scale of the crisis demands transformation, not reform. What is required to halt the sixth mass extinction is not incremental adjustment but fundamental system-wide change in how we produce, consume, govern, and relate to nature."**

**"The IPBES Transformative Change Assessment identifies five strategies: conserving biocultural diversity, mainstreaming biodiversity, transforming economic systems, reforming governance, and shifting societal values. Implementing these requires ending fossil fuel use by mid-century, protecting at least 30-50% of Earth's surface, halving emissions by 2030, and transitioning beyond growth-dependent capitalism."**

**"'Realistic' solutions that don't match the scale of the crisis are unrealistic - they merely make failure sound acceptable. The gap between what is required and what governments deliver is the measure of how seriously they take survival."**
