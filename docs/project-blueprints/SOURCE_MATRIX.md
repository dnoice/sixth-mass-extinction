## Usage Notes

### Source Selection Methodology

Where multiple sources exist for contested statistics, this matrix prioritizes:

1. **Conservative, high-credibility baselines** from authoritative institutions (IPBES, FAO, IMF, IPCC)
2. **Peer-reviewed topical papers** for mechanism analysis and magnitude validation
3. **Most recent authoritative releases** for time-sensitive or frequently updated figures

### Time-Sensitive Data

The following categories use the most current available data:

- Dead zone measurements (NOAA annual releases)
- Fisheries status (FAO SOFIA updates)
- Protected area coverage (CBD/UNEP-WCMC statistics)
- Subsidy calculations (IMF annual working papers)
- Carbon attribution (Carbon Majors Database updates)

### Cross-Reference Navigation

Use the **Sections** column to navigate directly to relevant portions of MASTER_BLUEPRINT.md. Sources are indexed to support multiple sections where applicable.
