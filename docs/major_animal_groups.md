# Sixth Mass Extinction (SME)

The Sixth Mass Extinction (SME) is an ongoing extinction event primarily caused by human activities. It is characterized by the rapid loss of biodiversity, with species disappearing at an unprecedented rate. The main drivers of this extinction crisis include habitat destruction, climate change, pollution, overfishing, and invasive species.
