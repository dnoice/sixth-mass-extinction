## Extinction & Conservation Terms

### Background Extinction Rate

The natural rate of species extinction without human influence, estimated at 0.1-1 E/MSY. Current rates are 100-1,000× higher.

### Biological Annihilation

Term describing massive population declines across species, not just extinctions. 32% of vertebrate species show declining populations.

### Coextinction

When one species' extinction causes the extinction of dependent species (parasites, mutualists, specialists). Amplification factor: 184.2%.

### Conservation Triage

Prioritizing which species to save when resources are limited; controversial approach acknowledging inability to save everything.

### Critically Endangered (CR)

IUCN Red List category for species facing extremely high risk of extinction in the wild.

### Defaunation

The loss of animal populations and species from ecosystems; "empty forest syndrome."

### Endangered (EN)

IUCN Red List category for species facing very high risk of extinction in the wild.

### Extinction Debt

Future extinctions already committed due to past habitat loss; effects delayed but inevitable. Amazon: 80-90% of extinctions yet to occur.

### Extinction Vortex

Downward spiral where small populations face increasing genetic, demographic, and environmental challenges.

### Functional Extinction

When a species exists in numbers too low to fulfill its ecological role, even if not technically extinct.

### Keystone Species

Species with disproportionately large ecological impact relative to abundance (e.g., wolves, sea otters).

### Mass Extinction

Rapid loss of >75% of species in geologically short timeframe. Five previous events; sixth ongoing.

### Paper Park

Protected area existing only on paper with no effective management or enforcement.

### Red List

IUCN's inventory of species' conservation status; categories from Least Concern to Extinct.

### Trophic Cascade

Chain reaction of ecological effects when a species (especially predator) is added or removed.

### Vulnerable (VU)

IUCN Red List category for species facing high risk of extinction in the wild.

## Ecological Concepts

### Biodiversity

Variety of life at genetic, species, and ecosystem levels.

### Biodiversity Hotspot

Region with exceptional endemic species concentrations facing exceptional habitat loss (36 global hotspots).

### Biome

Major ecological community type defined by climate and vegetation (e.g., tropical rainforest, tundra).

### Biotic Homogenization

Process where ecosystems become increasingly similar globally as invasives spread and natives decline.

### Carbon Sequestration

Capture and long-term storage of atmospheric CO₂ by forests, oceans, or geological formations.

### Ecological Footprint

Measure of human demand on Earth's ecosystems.

### Ecosystem Services

Benefits humans receive from ecosystems: provisioning, regulating, cultural, supporting. Valued at $125-145 trillion/year.

### Endemic Species

Species found only in a specific geographic area.

### Mesopredator Release

Increase in mid-level predators when top predators are removed, often devastating to prey species.

### Mutualism

Ecological relationship where both species benefit (e.g., pollinator-plant relationships).

### Phylogenetic Diversity

Measure of evolutionary history represented by a set of species; loss is permanent.

### Primary Productivity

Rate at which ecosystems produce organic matter through photosynthesis.

### Resilience

Ecosystem's ability to absorb disturbance and maintain function.

### Species-Area Relationship

Mathematical relationship between habitat area and species number; basis for extinction predictions from habitat loss.

### Trophic Level

Position in food chain (producers, primary consumers, secondary consumers, etc.).

## Climate & Environmental Terms

### Albedo

Reflectivity of a surface; ice loss reduces albedo, accelerating warming (feedback loop).

### Anthropocene

Proposed geological epoch defined by human impact on Earth systems; began ~1950s or earlier.

### Climate Refugee

Person displaced due to climate change effects; 200M-1.2B projected by 2050.

### Dead Zone

Hypoxic (low oxygen) ocean area where most marine life cannot survive. Gulf of Mexico: 6,705 sq mi.

### Feedback Loop

Self-reinforcing cycle (positive feedback) or self-limiting cycle (negative feedback) in climate system.

### Ocean Acidification

Decrease in ocean pH due to CO₂ absorption; threatens shell-forming organisms, coral.

### Permafrost

Permanently frozen ground containing 1,500 billion tonnes of carbon; thawing accelerates warming.

### Planetary Boundaries

Nine Earth system boundaries defining "safe operating space." 7 of 9 transgressed as of 2025.

### Tipping Point

Threshold beyond which a system shifts to new state; often irreversible on human timescales.

### Thermal Bleaching

Coral expulsion of symbiotic algae due to heat stress; 84% of reefs affected in 2024.

---

## Economic & Policy Terms

### Carbon Offset

Credit representing emissions reduction elsewhere; 87% found ineffective.

### Ecosystem Service Valuation

Monetary estimation of ecosystem benefits; $125-145 trillion annually globally.

### Externality

Cost (or benefit) not reflected in market prices; pollution is a negative externality.

### Greenwashing

Misleading environmental marketing; 58% of Fortune 2000 companies at risk.

### Natural Capital

Stock of natural assets (forests, water, biodiversity) providing ecosystem services.

### Subsidy

Government financial support; $7.1 trillion for fossil fuels (2022) vs. $70B protected area funding gap.

### 30x30

Goal to protect 30% of land and ocean by 2030 (Kunming-Montreal GBF target).
