#### Categories of Ecosystem Value

| Value Type | Definition | Examples |
|------------|------------|----------|
| **Direct Use Value** | Direct consumption or use | Timber, fish, crops, medicine |
| **Indirect Use Value** | Ecosystem functions supporting activity | Pollination, water purification, flood control |
| **Option Value** | Future potential uses | Undiscovered medicines, genetic resources |
| **Existence Value** | Value from knowing something exists | Endangered species, wilderness |
| **Bequest Value** | Value of leaving for future generations | Natural heritage, ecosystem integrity |

#### Use vs. Non-Use Values

```
Total Economic Value (TEV)
├── Use Values
│   ├── Direct Use (consumptive and non-consumptive)
│   ├── Indirect Use (ecosystem services)
│   └── Option Value (future potential)
└── Non-Use Values
    ├── Existence Value
    └── Bequest Value
```

| Coastal | $4,052 | $12.6 trillion |
| Tropical Forest | $2,007 | $3.8 trillion |
| Wetlands | $14,785 | $4.9 trillion |
| **Total Biosphere** | — | **$33 trillion** |

**Costanza et al. (2014) - Updated Assessment:**

**Context:** This exceeds global GDP (~$85 trillion in 2024)

#### Value Changes Over Time

| Period | Ecosystem Service Change | Economic Impact |
|--------|-------------------------|-----------------|
| 1997–2011 | Land use change losses | -$4.3–20.2 trillion/year |
| 2011–2024 | Continued degradation | -$5–10 trillion/year (estimated) |
| **Cumulative loss** | Since 1950 | -$30–50 trillion/year equivalent |

### 2.3 Valuation Methodologies

#### Primary Methods

| Method | Application | Strengths | Limitations |
|--------|-------------|-----------|-------------|
| **Market Price** | Traded goods (timber, fish) | Observable, objective | Ignores externalities |
| **Replacement Cost** | Water purification, flood control | Practical baseline | May under/overestimate |
| **Avoided Cost** | Disaster prevention | Clear counterfactual | Requires damage estimates |
| **Production Function** | Agricultural inputs | Links to GDP | Complex modeling |
| **Travel Cost** | Recreation/tourism | Revealed preference | Limited to recreation |
| **Hedonic Pricing** | Property values | Market-based | Isolating nature effect difficult |
| **Contingent Valuation** | Existence/bequest value | Captures non-use | Hypothetical bias |
| **Choice Experiments** | Multiple attributes | Trade-off analysis | Complex design |
| **Benefit Transfer** | Rapid assessment | Cost-effective | Context sensitivity |

#### Challenges in Valuation

1. **Non-linearity:** Ecosystem collapse creates discontinuous value loss
2. **Irreversibility:** Extinction cannot be assigned finite cost
3. **Uncertainty:** Future service provision unknown
4. **Substitutability:** Many services have no substitutes
5. **Distribution:** Benefits and costs fall on different groups
6. **Discounting:** How to value future generations' interests
