# Major & Minor Animal Groups

The Sixth Mass Extinction (SME) is an ongoing extinction event primarily driven by anthropogenic activities. Current extinction rates are estimated at 1,000-10,000 times the natural background rate, with approximately one million species facing extinction risk globally. The IUCN Red List (Version 2025-2) has assessed 169,420 species, with 47,187 (27.8%) classified as threatened with extinction.
