# Factual Accuracy Audit

> **Article:** Orphans of a Dying Wild: The Last Survivors of Broken Families and Vanishing Habitats
>
> **Audit Date:** 2026-01-06
>
> **Status:** CORRECTIONS APPLIED

## Executive Summary

The article "Orphans of a Dying Wild" presents a powerful narrative about wildlife orphans across elephants, orangutans, and marine mammals. The vast majority of claims are well-supported by conservation data. One significant error was found regarding annual rescue numbers at the Sheldrick Wildlife Trust, and one claim about forest elephant decline needs temporal clarification.

**Issues Found:** 0 Critical | 2 Errors | 1 Caution | 1 Minor

## Issues Identified

### ERROR-001: Sheldrick Wildlife Trust Annual Rescue Numbers

**Location:** Line 143

**Current Text:**
> "The Trust rescues perhaps two hundred orphans annually."

**Problem:**
This significantly overstates the Trust's rescue capacity. The Sheldrick Wildlife Trust has rescued **approximately 200-262 elephants in total** over its nearly 50-year history, not annually.

**Evidence:**

- "The Sheldrick Wildlife Trust has successfully rescued over 262 orphaned elephants" (total, not annual)
- "To date, the David Sheldrick Wildlife Trust has successfully rescued and hand-raised over 200 infant elephants through its Orphans' Project" (cumulative)
- The Trust was founded in 1977, so 262 rescues over ~48 years = ~5-6 elephants rescued per year on average

**Source:** [Sheldrick Wildlife Trust](https://www.sheldrickwildlifetrust.org/about), [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheldrick_Wildlife_Trust)

**Severity:** ERROR — Significant numerical overstatement

**Recommended Correction:**
> "The Trust has rescued over two hundred sixty orphans since its founding—an average of perhaps five or six annually."

OR simply:
> "The Trust has rescued over two hundred sixty orphans in its nearly fifty-year history."

---

### ERROR-002: Forest Elephant Decline Timeframe

**Location:** Line 71

**Current Text:**
> "Forest elephants—the smaller, genetically distinct species that inhabits the rainforests of Central Africa—have declined sixty-two percent since 2002 alone."

**Problem:**
The phrasing "since 2002 alone" implies an ongoing decline from 2002 to present. The 62% figure comes from Maisels et al. (2013), which measured decline **between 2002 and 2011** (a specific 9-year window), not from 2002 to present.

**Evidence:**

- "The total population of forest elephants declined by 62 percent between 2002 and 2011" (Maisels et al. 2013, PLOS ONE)
- More recent data (2024) shows the rate of decline has slowed to 0.7% per year since 2016

**Source:** [PLOS ONE](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0059469), [Mongabay 2026](http://news.mongabay.com/2026/01/poaching-down-but-threats-remain-for-forest-elephants-recent-population-assessment-finds/)

**Severity:** ERROR — Temporal inaccuracy

**Recommended Correction:**
> "Forest elephants—the smaller, genetically distinct species that inhabits the rainforests of Central Africa—declined sixty-two percent between 2002 and 2011."

---

### CAUTION-001: Marine Heat Wave Date Range

**Location:** Line 101

**Current Text:**
> "Between 2013 and 2017, marine mammal rescue centers along the California coast were overwhelmed by starving sea lion pups."

**Problem:**
"The Blob" marine heat wave is typically dated **2013-2016**, not 2013-2017. The peak impacts on sea lion pups occurred 2014-2015.

**Evidence:**

- "A marine heat wave lasting from 2013 to 2016 stranded sea lion pups" (NOAA)
- "The Blob is a large mass of relatively warm water... first detected in late 2013 and continued to spread throughout 2014 and 2015"
- Peak strandings: "During the first five months of 2015, more than 3,000 stranded sea lion pups"

**Source:** [NOAA Fisheries](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/feature-story/looking-back-blob-record-warming-drives-unprecedented-ocean-change)

**Severity:** CAUTION — Slight date inaccuracy

**Recommended Correction:**
> "Between 2013 and 2016, marine mammal rescue centers along the California coast were overwhelmed by starving sea lion pups."

---

### MINOR-001: Northern Fur Seal Decline Baseline

**Location:** Line 107

**Current Text:**
> "Northern fur seals in the Pribilof Islands have already declined by more than half since the 1980s"

**Issue:**
The >50% decline is typically measured from the **1950s**, not the 1980s. The Pribilof Islands population was designated as depleted in 1988 because it had already declined >50% from its 1950s peak of 2.2 million.

**Evidence:**

- "In 1988, the Pribilof Islands population was designated as a depleted stock under the MMPA because it had declined by more than 50 percent from its estimated population of 2.2 million seals in the 1950s"
- "Since 1975, the number of fur seals born each year has plummeted 57 percent"

**Source:** [NOAA Fisheries](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/species/northern-fur-seal)

**Severity:** MINOR — Baseline date imprecision

**Recommended Correction:**
> "Northern fur seals in the Pribilof Islands have already declined by more than half since the 1950s"

## Summary of Findings

| Severity | Count | Action Required |
|----------|-------|-----------------|
| CRITICAL | 0 | — |
| ERROR | 2 | Correct rescue numbers; fix timeframe |
| CAUTION | 1 | Adjust date range for "the Blob" |
| MINOR | 1 | Optional baseline correction |

## Assessment

This article demonstrates **strong factual accuracy** for its major claims about elephant populations, poaching statistics, orangutan habitat loss, and marine mammal strandings. The emotional narrative is well-grounded in verified conservation data. The most significant error—claiming 200 annual rescues at the Sheldrick Wildlife Trust when the actual figure is ~5-6 annually—should be corrected as it misrepresents the scale of rescue capacity versus the scale of the crisis.

**Recommendation:** Minor corrections required. The article's core message and supporting statistics are sound.

## Quick Reference: Corrections Needed

| Line | Current | Correct |
|------|---------|---------|
| 143 | "two hundred orphans annually" | ~5-6 annually (262+ total over ~50 years) |
| 71 | "since 2002 alone" | "between 2002 and 2011" |
| 101 | "Between 2013 and 2017" | "Between 2013 and 2016" |
| 107 | "since the 1980s" | "since the 1950s" (optional) |
