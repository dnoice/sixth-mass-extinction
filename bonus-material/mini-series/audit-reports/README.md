## Audit Process

### Verification Scope

1. **Scientific Claims** - Cross-referenced against IPCC, IPBES, NOAA, IUCN, FAO
1. **Mathematical Calculations** - Independent verification of all figures
1. **Internal Consistency** - Check for contradictions within article
1. **Source Attribution** - Verify cited sources support claims made
1. **Consensus vs. Disputed** - Flag claims that lack scientific consensus

### Severity Levels

| Level | Definition | Action |
| ----- | ---------- | ------ |
| CRITICAL | Factually incorrect | Immediate correction required |
| ERROR | Inconsistent/math wrong | Correct before publication |
| CAUTION | Disputed claim | Add qualifier |
