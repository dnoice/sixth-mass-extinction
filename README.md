# The Sixth Mass Extinction

## A Comprehensive Framework for Documenting Anthropogenic Planetary Collapse

> **Purpose:** Documentation, Attribution, Warning — Create an irrefutable record of what happened, who caused it, and who resisted.

---

## Project Overview

Earth is experiencing its sixth mass extinction event—the first caused entirely by a single species. Extinction rates are **100-1,000x above natural background levels**, with approximately **1 million species at risk**. This project provides comprehensive, evidence-based documentation of this ongoing catastrophe.

**Core Principles:**

- Truth over hope
- Direct language over euphemisms
- Systemic analysis over individual blame
- Every claim sourced and quantified

## Research Framework

The project follows a 10-part structure covering the full scope of the extinction crisis:

1. **Establishing the Crisis** — Extinction rates, magnitude, hotspots, historical context
2. **Primary Drivers** — Habitat destruction, extraction, climate, pollution, exploitation, invasives
3. **Ecological Collapse** — Trophic cascades, ecosystem services, biotic homogenization
4. **Economic Systems** — Capitalism, corporate power, governmental failure, consumption
5. **Environmental Justice** — Indigenous peoples, frontline communities
6. **What We're Losing** — Functional diversity, coextinction, evolutionary potential
7. **Tipping Points** — Planetary boundaries, irreversible thresholds
8. **Failed Solutions** — Technological optimism, conservation insufficiency
9. **Timeline & Urgency** — Extinction acceleration, irreversible thresholds
10. **Synthesis** — Systemic causation, survival questions, uncomfortable truths

## Contributing

### Current Status

This project is **not accepting direct contributions** at this time. The research framework, documentation standards, and editorial voice require tight consistency that makes open collaboration impractical during this phase.

That said, **thank you for considering**. Your interest in this work matters.

### Reporting Inaccuracies

If you notice information that is **inaccurate, misleading, outdated, or confusing**, we absolutely want to hear from you. Scientific integrity is non-negotiable.

**What to report:**

- Factual errors (incorrect statistics, misattributed sources, outdated data)
- Broken or dead citation links
- Misleading framing or context
- Logical inconsistencies
- Typographical errors that change meaning

**How to report:**

1. **Open an Issue** — Use the [GitHub Issues](../../issues) tab with the label `factual-correction`
2. **Be specific** — Reference the exact file, section, and problematic text
3. **Provide sources** — Include peer-reviewed citations or authoritative references when possible
4. **Explain the problem** — Describe why the current content is incorrect or misleading

### What We're Looking For

| Helpful | Not Helpful |
| ------- | ----------- |
| "The extinction rate in Section 2 cites 100x but IPBES 2019 states 100-1,000x" | "I think the numbers are wrong" |
| "This link to WWF report returns 404" | "Links don't work" |
| "The claim about amphibians contradicts the IUCN source provided" | "This doesn't seem right" |

### Future Contributions

As the project matures, we may open specific areas for contribution:

- Translation efforts
- Data visualization improvements
- Additional peer-reviewed source verification
- Accessibility enhancements

Watch this repository for updates on contribution opportunities.

### Code of Conduct

All interactions should reflect the project's core principles: **truth over hope, direct language over euphemisms, systemic analysis over individual blame**. We expect respectful, evidence-based discourse focused on improving the accuracy and impact of this documentation
