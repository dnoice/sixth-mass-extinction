<!-- Gemini:
This project is called the Sixth Mass Extinction (SME) Project
The scope of this project is to have a place for anyone and everyone to have access to an accessible, thourghly documented/sourced platform for exploring the driving forces behind the current issue
The difference between this project and others is going to be in the way we present and let users interact with this information
Some ideas include creating a MASTER_BLIUEPRINT with a total of ten parent section, 1.0, 2.0 ... 10.0 and each parent section then would have three to five sub-sections that would house all of the neccassry scaffolding/information for users to explore ie 1.1 - 1.*, 2.1 - 2.* ... 10.1 - 10.
Each sub-section would follow a very similair directory strucuture so that the learning curve for understanding how to navigate and explore the repo in a meaningful way is minimized.
The first parent section would naturaly be about introducing users to the on going issues of the SME and setting up a robust and comprehensive stage for the subsequent sections.
Parent Sections 2 - 9 would be the meat and potatoes of all the content and then Parent Section 10 would be for any other aspects that dont fit neatly into the prevouse sections or things like resources ect
Each sub-section would be a mini project all on its own with things like python notebooks for exploring datasets and the numbers/science behind current claims/trajectories/models ect they would also include one well written comprehensive article that contributes and builds upon the prevouse sub-sections information
Naturlly we would need to setup a system for things like bibliographies, sources, cited works, scripts, and most importantly transparancy into methodologies, uncertianties, gaps ect
Another idea is to create interactive dashbaords to explore maps from the geojson/shapfiles that we will be obtaining
A very hands on sort of implementation to this project is going to be key

Now, your job my friend is to explore the current content found (do not worry about any past prior git commits/pr/branches except for what is currently in the dir) in this project (it's not much since this is literally the foundation phasse and come up with a plan to get this MASTER_BLUEPRINT idea off the ground and running)
Oh, yes also, please always adhear to the standards found in docs\standards\DOCSTRING_STANDARDS.md

Let's get started!
