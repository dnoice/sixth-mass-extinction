# The Sixth Mass Extinction

## A Comprehensive Framework for Documenting Anthropogenic Planetary Collapse

> **Purpose:** Documentation, Attribution, Warning — Create an irrefutable record of what happened, who caused it, and who resisted.

---

## Project Overview

Earth is experiencing its sixth mass extinction event—the first caused entirely by a single species. Extinction rates are **100-1,000x above natural background levels**, with approximately **1 million species at risk**. This project provides comprehensive, evidence-based documentation of this ongoing catastrophe.

**Core Principles:**

- Truth over hope
- Direct language over euphemisms
- Systemic analysis over individual blame
- Every claim sourced and quantified

## Research Framework

The project follows a 10-part structure covering the full scope of the extinction crisis:

1. **Establishing the Crisis** — Extinction rates, magnitude, hotspots, historical context
2. **Primary Drivers** — Habitat destruction, extraction, climate, pollution, exploitation, invasives
3. **Ecological Collapse** — Trophic cascades, ecosystem services, biotic homogenization
4. **Economic Systems** — Capitalism, corporate power, governmental failure, consumption
5. **Environmental Justice** — Indigenous peoples, frontline communities
6. **What We're Losing** — Functional diversity, coextinction, evolutionary potential
7. **Tipping Points** — Planetary boundaries, irreversible thresholds
8. **Failed Solutions** — Technological optimism, conservation insufficiency
9. **Timeline & Urgency** — Extinction acceleration, irreversible thresholds
10. **Synthesis** — Systemic causation, survival questions, uncomfortable truths
