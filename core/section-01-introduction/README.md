✒ Description:
    Parent Section 1.0 serves as the gateway to the Sixth Mass Extinction Project.
    It defines the Anthropocene, presents the irrefutable evidence of the current
    biological crisis, and establishes the "Technosphere" concept. This section
    aims to onboard users with a clear, scientifically grounded reality check.

✒ Key Features:
    - Feature 1: Sub-section 1.1 - The Sixth Extinction Defined (Definitions & Rates)
    - Feature 2: Sub-section 1.2 - The Evidence (Global Indicators)
    - Feature 3: Sub-section 1.3 - The Human Footprint (The Technosphere)
    - Feature 4: Sub-section 1.4 - Project Manifesto (Methodology)

✒ Usage Instructions:

# 🟢 Section 1.0: Introduction & The Anthropocene

> **"The Anthropocene: The epoch where human activity has become the dominant influence on climate and the environment."**

## Overview
This section sets the stage for the entire project. We move beyond hyperbole and look at the raw data: how does the current rate of species loss compare to the "background rate" of the past 500 million years? What is the "Technosphere," and how much does it weigh compared to the Biosphere?

## Sub-Section Roadmap

### [ ] 1.1 The Sixth Extinction Defined
*Comparing current extinction rates (E/MSY) against the background rate.*
- **Planned Content:**
  - Article: "The Background Rate vs. The Anthropocene Rate"
  - Notebook: `background_rate_comparison.ipynb` (Visualizing E/MSY)

### [ ] 1.2 The Evidence
*The smoking gun data from IUCN, WWF, and IPBES.*
- **Planned Content:**
  - Article: "The Red List Reality"
  - Notebook: `iucn_red_list_analysis.ipynb`

### [ ] 1.3 The Human Footprint
*Understanding the scale of human impact.*
- **Planned Content:**
  - Article: "Weighing the Technosphere"
  - Notebook: `human_footprint_calculator.ipynb`

### [ ] 1.4 Project Manifesto
*Our commitment to open science and transparency.*
- **Planned Content:**
  - Document: "SME Project Methodology & Ethics"
