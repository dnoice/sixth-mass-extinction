✒ Description:
    The authoritative scope and roadmap for Subsection 1.1. This mini-project
    focuses on scientifically defining the "Sixth Mass Extinction" by rigorously
    comparing current extinction rates (E/MSY) against the background rate
    established in the fossil record. It establishes the quantitative foundation
    for the entire project.

✒ Key Features:
    - Feature 1: Definition of E/MSY (Extinctions per Million Species-Years)
    - Feature 2: Comparative analysis of Background Rate (0.1-1.0 E/MSY) vs. Anthropocene Rate
    - Feature 3: Analysis of IUCN Red List trends for major vertebrate groups
    - Feature 4: Validation of the "100-1000x" multiplier claim
    - Feature 5: Exploratory modeling of "Time to 75%" (Mass Extinction Threshold)

✒ Usage Instructions:
    This document governs the development of Subsection 1.1.
    All outputs in the 'outputs/' directory must align with the objectives defined here.

# 📐 Subsection 1.1 Blueprint: The Sixth Extinction Defined

> **Objective:** To provide a statistically rigorous, irrefutable definition of the current extinction crisis, moving beyond qualitative descriptions to quantitative metrics.

---

## 1. Scope & Boundaries

### In Scope
- **Metric Definition:** Explaining and calculating E/MSY.
- **Background Rate:** Establishing the baseline (fossil record average).
- **Current Rate:** Calculating modern rates for Vertebrates (Mammals, Birds, Amphibians, Reptiles, Fish).
- **Comparison:** Direct statistical comparison to quantify the magnitude of deviation.
- **Terminology:** Defining "Mass Extinction" (75% loss) vs. "Background Extinction".

### Out of Scope
- **Specific Drivers:** (Reserved for Section 4.0 - Ecological Drivers).
- **Economic Impacts:** (Reserved for Section 7.0 - Socio-Economic Impacts).
- **Deep Time History:** (Detailed in Section 2.0, only summary stats used here).
