# ⚠️ Uncertainty & Limitations

## 1. Taxonomic Bias: The Vertebrate Lens
Our analysis focuses heavily on **Vertebrates** (Mammals, Birds, Amphibians, Reptiles, Fish).
*   **The Bias:** Vertebrates represent less than 3% of all described animal species. Invertebrates (insects, crustaceans, arachnids) make up the vast majority of biodiversity but are severely under-assessed by the IUCN.
*   **Implication:** Our calculated extinction rates might not represent the "Global" rate for all life. However, since vertebrates are generally larger and more resilient than many invertebrates, the invertebrate extinction rate is likely *higher*, not lower.

## 2. Extinction Debt (Time Lag)
Extinction is rarely an instant event; it is a process.
*   **The Lag:** There is often a delay of decades or centuries between the habitat destruction that "dooms" a population and the death of the last individual.
*   **Implication:** Current E/MSY calculations measure *past* failures. They likely underestimate the *committed* extinction rate caused by human activity in the last 50 years (e.g., climate change impacts that haven't killed the last individual yet).

## 3. The "Lazarus Effect"
*   **Definition:** The rediscovery of a species previously declared Extinct.
*   **Frequency:** While rare, it happens.
*   **Mitigation:** This is why we separate the "Conservative" (EX only) and "High" (EX+EW+PE) scenarios. Even if a handful of species are rediscovered, the statistical magnitude of the crisis (100x elevation) remains unaffected.

## 4. Data Deficient (DD) Species
A significant number of assessed species are listed as "Data Deficient" (DD).
*   **Our Method:** We count DD species in the "Total Assessed" (denominator) but assume 0 of them are extinct.
*   **Risk:** It is highly probable that many DD species are rare, restricted, and possibly already extinct. By treating them as "safe," our E/MSY calculations are mathematically conservative and likely underestimate the true rate of loss.
