✒ Description:
    The definitive deep-dive article for Subsection 1.1. This document defines the
    Anthropocene extinction crisis through the lens of quantitative data, specifically
    comparing the current E/MSY (Extinctions per Million Species-Years) against the
    background rate derived from the fossil record.

✒ Key Features:
    - Feature 1: Definition of "Mass Extinction" (75% species loss threshold)
    - Feature 2: Explanation of the Background Rate (0.1 - 1.0 E/MSY)
    - Feature 3: Current Extinction Rates (100 - 1000x higher)
    - Feature 4: Analysis of vertebrate loss since 1500
    - Feature 5: The "Event Horizon" projection

✒ Usage Instructions:
    Read this article to understand the core thesis of the project: that we are
    mathematically and statistically in the early stages of a mass extinction event.

# 📉 The Sixth Extinction Defined: A Statistical Reality

> **Abstract:** The term "Sixth Mass Extinction" is not merely a rhetorical device; it is a statistical observation. By normalizing extinction rates to Extinctions per Million Species-Years (E/MSY), we demonstrate that current biodiversity loss exceeds the natural background rate by orders of magnitude, a trajectory that mirrors the onset of the "Big Five" mass extinctions.
