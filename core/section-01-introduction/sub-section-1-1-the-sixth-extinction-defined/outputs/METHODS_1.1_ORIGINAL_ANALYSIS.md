✒ Description:
    Documentation of the exploratory data analysis and novel modeling approaches
    undertaken in Subsection 1.1, specifically regarding the "Time to 75%"
    projections and cumulative extinction curves.

✒ Key Features:
    - Feature 1: Rationale for linear vs. exponential projection models
    - Feature 2: Selection of taxonomic groups for sensitivity analysis
    - Feature 3: Interpretation of "Event Horizon" results

✒ Usage Instructions:
    This document explains the "why" and "how" of the exploratory notebooks
    (1.1_explore_*.ipynb).
