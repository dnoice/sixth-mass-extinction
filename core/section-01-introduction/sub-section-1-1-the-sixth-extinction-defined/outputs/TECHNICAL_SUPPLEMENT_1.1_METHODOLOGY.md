# 🧮 Technical Supplement: E/MSY Methodology

## 1. The E/MSY Metric
The standard metric for comparing extinction rates across deep time and the modern era is **Extinctions per Million Species-Years (E/MSY)**.

### Formula
$$ E/MSY = \frac{\text{Number of Extinctions}}{\text{Total Species Assessed} \times \text{Time Interval (Years)}} \times 1,000,000 $$

## 2. Assumptions
