# ⚖️ The Red List Reality: A World in Waiting

> **"Extinction is the end of the line. But the line is currently a queue of millions."**

## 1. The Shadow of George
Lonesome George was an Endling, but before he was an Endling, he was a member of the "Threatened." For decades, he sat in the category of **Critically Endangered**.

This article moves from the finality of death to the agony of the waiting room. We look at the IUCN Red List not as a catalog of failures, but as a map of the impending collapse.
