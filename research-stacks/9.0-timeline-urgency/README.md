# Series 9: Timeline & Urgency

> **Theme:** The acceleration of extinction and shrinking window for action

---

## Episodes

| Episode | Title | Focus | Blueprint |
| ------- | ----- | ----- | --------- |
| [9.1](./9.1-extinction-acceleration/) | Extinction Acceleration | Historical rates, biological annihilation, LPI 2024 | MB_SS-9.1 |
| [9.2](./9.2-irreversible-thresholds/) | Irreversible Thresholds | Critical transitions, extinction debt, collapse dynamics | MB_SS-9.2 |

## Key Statistics

- **Rate Acceleration:** Pre-1500 (1×) → 2000-present (100-1000×)
- **LPI Decline:** 73% wildlife loss (85% freshwater, 95% Latin America)
- **Biological Annihilation:** 32% vertebrate species declining
- **Bird Loss:** 3 billion lost (North America alone)
- **Insect Crisis:** 40% at extinction risk
- **Extinction Debt:** Amazon 80-90% of extinctions yet to occur

---

## Historical Collapse Examples

- **Passenger Pigeon:** Billions → 0 in ~50 years
- **Grand Banks Cod:** 99% collapse in <3 years, no recovery 30+ years

---

## Core Framing

**"Acceleration + Thresholds = Urgency"**

The 2030 deadline is a **physical constraint**, not a policy preference.

---

## Target Output

- **Articles:** 2 × 8,000-10,000 words = 16,000-20,000 words
- **Visualizations:** 20-24 figures total
