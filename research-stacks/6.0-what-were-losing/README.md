## Episodes

| Episode | Title | Focus | Blueprint |
| ------- | ----- | ----- | --------- |
| [6.1](./6.1-functional-diversity/) | Functional Diversity | Medical potential, ecosystem services, biomimicry | MB_SS-6.1 |
| [6.2](./6.2-coextinction/) | Coextinction | Dependent species, network fragility, 184% amplification | MB_SS-6.2 |
| [6.3](./6.3-evolutionary-potential/) | Evolutionary Potential | Phylogenetic diversity, 3-5M year recovery | MB_SS-6.3 |

## Key Statistics

- **Medical Potential:** 70% of cancer drugs from natural sources
- **Coextinction Amplifier:** 184.2% - each extinction triggers more
- **Evolutionary Loss:** 2.5B years (mammals) + 3B years (birds) at risk
- **Recovery Time:** 3-5 million years minimum after mass extinction
- **Vulture Collapse:** $69.4 billion damages (India case study)

## Core Framing

Species counts underestimate loss. Focus on:
- **Functional diversity** (what species DO)
- **Coextinction cascades** (hidden multipliers)
- **Evolutionary permanence** (timescales beyond human comprehension)

## Target Output

- **Articles:** 3 × 8,000-10,000 words = 24,000-30,000 words
- **Visualizations:** 30-36 figures total
