## Key Statistics

- **Boundaries Crossed:** 7 of 9 planetary boundaries transgressed (2025)
- **Amazon Threshold:** Currently 17-20%, tipping at 20-25%
- **Coral Bleaching:** 84.4% affected in 4th global event (2024)
- **Ice Sheet Loss:** 27 consecutive years Greenland loss
- **AMOC Status:** "On route to tipping" (2025-2095)
- **Permafrost Carbon:** 1,500 billion tonnes at risk

## Core Framing

Earth is **outside safe operating space**. These aren't warnings - they're **observed transgressions**.
