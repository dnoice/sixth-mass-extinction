## 7. CONFIDENCE CALIBRATION

### How We Assign Confidence Levels

| Level | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| **Very High** | Multiple independent lines of evidence, peer-reviewed consensus, robust to sensitivity analysis |
| **High** | Strong evidence base, minor disagreements in literature, mostly robust to assumptions |
| **Medium** | Evidence supports claim but with notable limitations, some sensitivity to assumptions |
| **Low** | Limited evidence, significant uncertainty, conclusions could change with new data |
| **Very Low** | Speculative, insufficient data, primarily theoretical |
