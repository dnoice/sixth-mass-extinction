## Executive Summary

### Overall Assessment

| Metric | Value |
| ------ | ----- |
| Total Issues Found | 4 |
| Critical Errors | 0 |
| Standard Errors | 1 |
| Caution Items | 2 |
| Minor Issues | 1 |
| Claims Verified Accurate | 40+ |
| Audit Confidence | High |

### Priority Actions Required

1. **HIGH:** Revise lion population decline claim (Line 47) - baseline figure disputed
1. **MEDIUM:** Remove or qualify "millions" claim for historical jaguar population (Line 73)
1. **MEDIUM:** Note that trophy hunting 3% figure is contested by industry (Line 45)
1. **LOW:** Adjust funding gap arithmetic (Line 145)

### Recommendation

This article demonstrates **strong factual foundation** with extensive verification against authoritative sources. The vast majority of claims—including corporate deforestation exposure, wildlife trafficking figures, environmental defender deaths, and economic data—are well-supported. However, **two population decline claims use disputed baseline figures** that should be qualified. No critical errors were found.

---

## Audit Methodology

### Verification Approach

1. **Wildlife Statistics:** Verified against IUCN Red List, WWF, and peer-reviewed population studies
1. **Deforestation Data:** Cross-referenced with FAO Global Forest Resources Assessment 2020
1. **Corporate Accountability:** Verified against Trase, Global Witness, and investigative journalism
1. **Economic Figures:** Confirmed with IMF, Paulson Institute, and FAO reports
1. **Human Rights Data:** Verified against Global Witness environmental defenders database
1. **Mathematical Verification:** All calculations independently verified

### Severity Classification

| Level | Definition | Action Required |
| ----- | ---------- | --------------- |
| **CRITICAL** | Factually incorrect; undermines credibility | Immediate correction |
| **ERROR** | Uses disputed data without qualification | Correction before publication |
| **CAUTION** | Contested claim presented as consensus | Add qualifier or alternative figure |
| **MINOR** | Imprecise but not materially incorrect | Recommended refinement |

## Detailed Findings

### Issue #1: Lion Population Decline Baseline [ERROR]

**Location:** Line 47

**Current Text:**
> "But lion populations have fallen ninety percent since 1950—from 200,000 to 20,000—during the very era of 'scientific' hunting management."

**Problem:**
The 200,000 baseline figure is **widely cited but scientifically disputed**. Peer-reviewed research indicates this figure lacks empirical foundation.

**Evidence:**

| Source | Finding |
| ------ | ------- |
| Loveridge et al. (2022), *Diversity and Distributions* | "A baseline figure of 200,000 is often cited relating to either the 1970s or the early 20th century, but this estimate **does not appear to be based on any empirical data or analysis**." |
| Same study | Estimated ~92,000 lions in 1970 based on range and density projections |
| Current estimates | 20,000-25,000 lions remain |
| Calculated decline | ~75% from rigorous baseline, not 90% |

**Source:** [Wiley - Where have all the lions gone?](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ddi.13637)

**Impact:** The 90% figure overstates the documented decline by approximately 15 percentage points.

**Recommended Correction:**
> "Lion populations have fallen by an estimated seventy-five percent since the 1970s—from approximately 100,000 to fewer than 25,000—during the very era of 'scientific' hunting management. Some estimates suggest even steeper declines from disputed historical baselines."

---

### Issue #2: Jaguar Historical Population [CAUTION]

**Location:** Line 73

**Current Text:**
> "Fifteen thousand jaguars remain where millions once prowled."

**Problem:**
No scientific evidence supports a historical jaguar population in the "millions." The highest documented estimates are approximately 300,000.

**Evidence:**

| Source | Historical Estimate |
| ------ | ------------------- |
| Population estimates (1960s) | ~300,000 |
| Current estimates | 60,000-173,000 (varies by source) |
| IUCN assessment | 20-25% decline since mid-1990s |
| Range loss | ~55% of historical range |

**Source:** [IELC Jaguar Fact Sheet](https://ielc.libguides.com/sdzg/factsheets/jaguar/population)

**Impact:** The "millions" claim is hyperbolic and unsupported. The 15,000 figure also appears to be on the low end of estimates.

**Recommended Correction:**
> "Perhaps 60,000 jaguars remain where hundreds of thousands once prowled—a loss of more than half their historical range."

OR if using lower estimates:
> "Jaguar populations have declined by more than half since the 1960s, with estimates ranging from 15,000 to over 60,000 depending on methodology."

---

### Issue #3: Trophy Hunting Revenue Distribution [CAUTION]

**Location:** Line 45

**Current Text:**
> "A 2017 study examined trophy hunting revenue across eight African countries and found that only three percent reached local communities."

**Problem:**
While the 3% figure is documented in peer-reviewed literature (Economists at Large, 2013), it is **actively contested** by hunting industry groups who claim the methodology is flawed.

**Evidence:**

| Source | Position |
| ------ | -------- |
| Economists at Large (2013) | 3% reaches communities |
| International Council for Game and Wildlife Conservation (CIC) | Disputes methodology, claims higher benefit |
| Country-specific data | Varies: Cameroon <3%, Zambia 12%, Tanzania communities rarely receive mandated 25% |

**Source:** [Ecolarge - The $200 Million Question](https://www.ecolarge.com/work/the-200-million-question-how-much-does-trophy-hunting-really-contribute-to-african-communities/)

**Impact:** Presenting a contested figure as definitive fact may invite criticism. The claim is defensible but should acknowledge dispute.

**Recommended Correction:**
> "A 2013 economic analysis found that only three percent of trophy hunting revenue reached local communities—a figure the hunting industry disputes but has not convincingly refuted."

---

### Issue #4: Conservation Funding Gap Arithmetic [MINOR]

**Location:** Line 145

**Current Text:**
> "The cost estimate for adequate global conservation funding is $700 billion annually. Current funding stands at approximately $120 billion. The gap is $600 billion per year."

**Problem:**
$700B - $120B = $580B, not $600B. The gap is rounded up.

**Verification:**
The Paulson Institute report (2020) estimates:

- Required: $722-967 billion annually
- Current: $124-143 billion annually
- Gap: ~$600-700 billion (using midpoints)

**Impact:** The rounding is reasonable given the range in underlying estimates, but the arithmetic as presented doesn't match.

**Recommended Correction:**
> "The cost estimate for adequate global conservation funding is $700-900 billion annually. Current funding stands at approximately $120-140 billion. The gap exceeds $600 billion per year."

OR simply:
> "The gap between current conservation funding and what is needed exceeds $600 billion per year."
